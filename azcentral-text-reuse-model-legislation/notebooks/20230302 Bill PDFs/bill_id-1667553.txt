B.  If a person received gender transition surgery while such 

person was under eighteen (18) years of age and if the gender 

transition surgery caused the person to not be able to enjoy the

surgery, the person may bring an action against his or her parent or 

legal guardian who consented to the gender transition surgery on 

behalf of the minor. 

C.  If the person is under eighteen (18) years of age, he or she 

may bring an action: 

1.  Throughout their minority through a parent or legal 

guardian, provided that the parent or legal guardian is not the same 

parent or legal guardian who consented to gender transition surgery 

on behalf of the minor; and 

2.  In their own name upon reaching majority. 

D.  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall 

be no time limitation for the commencement of an action brought 

under this section except as provided by this subsection. 

2.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff, 

based solely on his or her age, would be capable of bearing children 

if not for the gender transition surgery. 

3.  If the presumption described in paragraph 2 of this 

subsection is successfully rebutted, the court shall dismiss the 

cause of action.
