or pay for any medical procedure or service which violates his, her, 

or its conscience. 

B.  Limitations.  The exercise of the right of conscience is 

limited to conscience-based objections to a particular medical 

procedure or service.  This section may not be construed to waive or 

modify any duty a health care practitioner, health care institution, 

or health care payer may have to provide other medical procedures or

C.  Immunity from Liability.  No medical practitioner,

procedure or service.  No healthcare institution shall be civilly, 

criminally, or administratively liable for the exercise of 

conscience rights not to participate in a medical procedure or 

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted 

admitting privileges by the healthcare institution. 

D.  Discrimination.  No medical practitioner, healthcare 

institution, or healthcare payer shall be discriminated against in

participate in or pay for a medical procedure or service on the 

basis of conscience.

E.  Exception.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 

to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, healthcare 

institution, or healthcare payer that holds itself out to the public 

as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a 

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or 

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the 

right to make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting 

privilege decisions consistent with its religious beliefs. 

F.  Opt-In Required.  A health care practitioner may not be 

scheduled for, assigned, or requested to directly or indirectly 

perform, facilitate, refer for, or participate in an abortion unless 

the practitioner first affirmatively consents in writing to perform, 

facilitate, refer for, or participate in the abortion.  This 

subsection does not establish a right to participate in an abortion

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical 

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. Section 1395dd.

requirements of Section 1-731.4 of Title 63 of the Oklahoma 

Statutes.

A.  No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in 

any manner because the medical practitioner: 

1.  Provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or 

cause to be provided to his or her employer, the Attorney General,

conscience, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office 

of Civil Rights, or any other federal agency charged with protecting

such violation; or 

3.  Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or 

participate, in such a proceeding. 

B.  Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no 

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner 

because the medical practitioner disclosed any information that the 

medical practitioner reasonably believes evinces: 

1.  Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation; 

2.  Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of 

any medical procedure or service; or 

3.  Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of

health at risk, or a substantial and specific danger to public 

health or safety. 

C.  A licensing board may not reprimand, sanction, or revoke or 

threaten to revoke a license, certificate, or registration of a 

health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive 

activity protected under the First Amendment to the U.S. 

Constitution, unless the licensing board demonstrates beyond a 

reasonable doubt that the practitioner’s speech was the direct cause 

of physical harm to a person with whom the health care practitioner 

had a practitioner-patient relationship within the three (3) years 

immediately preceding the incident of physical harm. 

1.  The licensing board must provide a medical practitioner with 

any complaints it has received which may result in the revocation of 

the medical practitioner’s license, certification, or registration, 

within seven (7) days after receipt of the complaint. 

2.  The licensing board must pay the medical practitioner an 

administrative penalty of $500 for each day the complaint is not 

provided to the medical practitioner after the specified seven (7) 

days. 

SECTION 5.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1-728k of Title 63, unless there 

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

A.  Civil Action for Violation of Right of Conscience.  A civil 

action for damages or injunctive relief—or both—may be brought by

any medical practitioner, healthcare institution, or healthcare 

payer for any violation of any provision of this act.  Any 

additional burden or expense on another medical practitioner, 

healthcare institution, or healthcare payer arising from the 

exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any 

violation of this act.  However, no civil action may be brought 

against an individual who declines to use or purchase medical 

procedure or services from a specific medical practitioner, 

healthcare institution, or healthcare payer for exercising the 

rights granted in subsection A of Section 3 of this act. 

B.  Other Remedies.  Any party aggrieved by any violation of 

this act may commence a civil action and shall be entitled—upon the 

finding of a violation—to recover threefold his, her, or its actual 

damages sustained, along with the costs of the action and reasonable 

attorney fees.  Such damages shall be cumulative and in no way 

limited by any other remedies which may be available under any other 

federal, state, or municipal law.  A court considering such civil 

action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is 

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to his or 

her previous position, reinstatement of board certification, and re-

licensure of a healthcare institution or healthcare payer. 

SECTION 6.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1-728l of Title 63, unless there 

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, shall be 

construed so as to give it the maximum effect permitted by law, 

unless such holding shall be one of utter invalidity or 

unenforceability, in which event such provision shall be deemed 

severable herefrom and shall not affect the remainder hereof or the 

application of such provision to other persons not similarly 

situated or to other, dissimilar circumstances. 

SECTION 7.  This act shall become effective November 1, 2023.
