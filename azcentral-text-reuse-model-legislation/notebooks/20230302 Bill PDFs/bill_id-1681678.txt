A BILL ENTITLED 

 

AN ACT concerning 1 

 

Education – Interscholastic and Intramural Junior Varsity and Varsity Teams 2 

and Sports – Designation Based on Sex 3 

(Save Women’s Sports Act) 4 

 

FOR the purpose of requiring certain interscholastic and intramural junior varsity and 5 

varsity athletic teams or sports sponsored by certain schools to be expressly 6 

designated based on biological sex; prohibiting certain entities from taking certain 7 

adverse actions against a school or county board of education for maintaining 8 

separate interscholastic and intramural junior varsity and varsity athletic teams 9 

and sports for students of the female sex; providing that certain individuals have the 10 

right to bring a civil action under certain circumstances; and generally relating to 11 

interscholastic and intramural junior varsity and varsity teams and sports of public 12 

and nonpublic schools. 13 

 

BY adding to 14 

 Article – Education 15 

Section 7–118 16 

 Annotated Code of Maryland 17 

 (2022 Replacement Volume) 18 

 

Preamble 19 

 

 WHEREAS, The General Assembly finds that there are two biological sexes, female 20 

and male, and that a person’s sex is objectively determined by genetics and anatomy 21 

existing at the time of birth; and 22 

 



2 HOUSE BILL 359  

 

 

 WHEREAS, There are “[i]nherent differences between men and women,” and that 1 

these differences “remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of 2 

either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s opportunity.” United States v. 3 

Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and 4 

 

 WHEREAS, The “inherent differences” between men and women range from 5 

chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological differences; and 6 

 

 WHEREAS, Men generally have “denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments” 7 

and “larger hearts, greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and 8 

higher hemoglobin.” Neel Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, PSYCHOL. TODAY (July 2, 9 

2012), https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide–andseek/201207/the–battle–the–sexes; 10 

and 11 

 

 WHEREAS, Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits 12 

such as hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the 13 

development of Type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate 14 

higher speed and power during physical activity. Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, 15 

80 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, 16 

Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got Testosterone?, N.Y. TIMES (Aug. 21, 2008)); and  17 

 

 WHEREAS, The biological differences between females and males, especially as they 18 

relate to natural levels of testosterone, “explain the male and female secondary sex 19 

characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most 20 

important for success in sport: categorically different strength, speed, and endurance.” 21 

Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, “Comparing Athletic Performances: The 22 

Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,” Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy, 23 

https://web.law.duke.edu/sports/sex–sport/comparative–athletic–performance/; and  24 

 

 WHEREAS, While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme 25 

Court has recognized that “sex classifications may be used to compensate women for 26 

particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment 27 

opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s 28 

people.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (internal citations and 29 

quotation marks omitted); and 30 

 

 WHEREAS, One place where sex classifications allow for the “full development of 31 

the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people” is in the context of sports and athletics; 32 

and 33 

 

 WHEREAS, Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences 34 

between males and females result in different athletic capabilities. See, e.g., Kleczek v. 35 

Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (“Because of innate 36 

physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic 37 

competition.”); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass’n, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting 38 

that “high school boys [generally possess physiological advantages over] their girl 39 



 HOUSE BILL 359 3 

 

 

counterparts” and that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports 1 

like “high school track”); and 2 

 

 WHEREAS, A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 3 

found that, although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the “gender 4 

gap” between female and male performances remained stable. “These suggest that women’s 5 

performances at the high level will never match those of men.” Valerie Thibault, et al., 6 

Women and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 7 

Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010); and 8 

 

 WHEREAS, As Duke Law professor and All–American track athlete Doriane 9 

Coleman, tennis champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya 10 

Richards–Ross recently wrote: “The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in 11 

every sport except sailing, shooting and riding, there will always be significant numbers of 12 

boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head–to–head competition. 13 

Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science.” Doriane Coleman, Martina 14 

Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don’t Abandon Title IX, WASHINGTON 15 

POST (Apr. 29, 2019), https://wapo.st/2VKlNN1; and 16 

 

 WHEREAS, The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes are not 17 

diminished through the use of puberty blockers and cross–sex hormones. A recent study on 18 

the impact of such treatments found that policies like those of the International Olympic 19 

Committee that require biological males to undergo at least one year of testosterone 20 

suppression before competing in women’s sports do not create a level playing field. “[T]he 21 

reduction in testosterone levels required by many sports federation transgender policies is 22 

insufficient to remove or reduce the male advantage by any meaningful degree.” For 23 

example, “the muscle mass advantage males possess over females, and potentially the 24 

performance implications thereof, are not removed by 12 months of testosterone 25 

suppression.” Instead, the study concluded that “The data presented here demonstrates 26 

that the male physical performance advantage over females, attributed to superior 27 

anthropometric and muscle mass/strength parameters achieved at puberty, is not removed 28 

by the current regimen of testosterone suppression permitting participation of transgender 29 

women in female sports categories. Rather, it appears that the male performance 30 

advantage is largely retained by transgender women and thus remains substantial.” 31 

Hilton, E.N.; Lundberg, T.R. Transgender Women in The Female Category of Sport: Is the 32 

Male Performance Advantage Removed by Testosterone Suppression?. Preprints 2020, 33 

2020050226 (doi: 10.20944/preprints202005.0226.v1); and 34 

 

 WHEREAS, Having separate sex–specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex 35 

equality. Sex–specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes 36 

to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with 37 

opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous 38 

other long–term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors; now, therefore, 39
