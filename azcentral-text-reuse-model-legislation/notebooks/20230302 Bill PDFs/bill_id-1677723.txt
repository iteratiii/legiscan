(7)(8) "Matter" or "material," any book, magazine, newspaper, or other printed or written 1 

material; or any picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture, or other pictorial 2

(10)(11) "Obscene live conduct," any physical human body activity, whether performed 12 

or engaged in alone or with other persons, including singing, speaking, dancing, 13 

acting, simulation, or pantomiming, where: 14 

(a) The dominant theme of such conduct, taken as a whole, appeals to a 15

community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual 18 

matters; and 19 

(c) The conduct is without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 20 

In prosecutions under §§ 22-24-27 to 22-24-37, inclusive, if circumstances of 21

conduct; 25 

(11)(12) "Obscene material," material: 26 

(a) The dominant theme of which, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient 27

prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the 1 

matter; 2 

(12)(13) "Prurient interest," a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, 3 

which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or 4 

representation of such matters. If it appears from the character of the material or 5

a state of sexual stimulation or arousal. 18 

Section 2. That § 22-24-30 be AMENDED: 19 

22-24-30. A person is guilty of disseminating material harmful to minors if, with 20 

reference to a motion picture, show, or other presentation which depicts nudity, sexual 21 

conduct, or sado-masochistic abuse, or drag performance, and which is harmful to minors, 22 

that person knowingly: 23
