district or charter school may order the production of any  171 

learning materials or other materials or activities, as  172

the authority delegated in this section shall become  220 

effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of  221 

the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section  222 

536.028.  This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and  223 

if any of the powers vested with the general assembly  224 

pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective  225 

date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently  226 

held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking  227 

authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,  228
