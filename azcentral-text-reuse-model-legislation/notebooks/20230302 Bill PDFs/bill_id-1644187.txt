exceed the deferred tax assets of a combined group as defined in 3 

KRS 141.202, as computed in accordance with accounting 4 

principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 5 

3. Only publicly traded companies, including affiliated corporations 6 

participating in the filing of a publicly traded company's financial 7 

statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 8 

accepted in the United States of America, as of January 1, 2019, shall be 9 

eligible for this deduction. 10 

4. If the provisions of KRS 141.202 result in an aggregate increase to the 11 

member's net deferred tax liability, an aggregate decrease to the 12 

member's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net 13 

deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the combined group 14 

shall be entitled to a deduction, as determined in this paragraph. 15 

5. For ten (10) years beginning with the combined group's first taxable 16 

year beginning on or after January 1, 2024, a combined group shall be 17 

entitled to a deduction from the combined group's entire net income 18 

equal to one-tenth (1/10) of the amount necessary to offset the increase 19 

in the net deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or 20 

aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax 21 

liability. The increase in the net deferred tax liability, decrease in the net 22 

deferred tax asset, or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset 23 

to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that 24 

would result from the imposition of the combined reporting requirement 25 

under KRS 141.202, but for the deduction provided under this paragraph 26 

as of June 27, 2019. 27

6. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this paragraph 1 

shall be converted to the annual deferred tax deduction amount, as 2 

follows: 3 

a. The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of this 4 

paragraph shall be divided by the tax rate determined under KRS 5 

141.040; 6 

b. The resulting amount shall be further divided by the 7 

apportionment factor determined by KRS 141.120 or 141.121 that 8 

was used by the combined group in the calculation of the deferred 9 

tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as described in subparagraph 10 

5. of this paragraph; and 11 

c. The resulting amount represents the total net deferred tax 12 

deduction available over the ten (10) year period as described in 13 

subparagraph 5. of this paragraph. 14 

7. The deduction calculated under this paragraph shall not be adjusted as a 15 

result of any events happening subsequent to the calculation, including 16 

but not limited to any disposition or abandonment of assets. The 17 

deduction shall be calculated without regard to the federal tax effect and 18 

shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under this 19 

section is greater than the combined group's entire Kentucky net income, 20 

any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction 21 

to the combined group's entire net income in future taxable years until 22 

fully utilized. 23 

8. Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this 24 

paragraph shall file a statement with the department on or before July 1, 25 

2019. The statement shall specify the total amount of the deduction 26 

which the combined group claims on the form, including calculations 27
