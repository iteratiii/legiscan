(2) Upon a student's enrollment and at the beginning of each school year, the district 14 

shall provide a notification to the student's parents listing each of the health 15 

services and mental health services available at the student's school and of the 16 

parents' right to withhold consent or decline any specific service. A parent's 17

provider. 1 

(4) School districts and district personnel shall respect the rights of parents to make 2 

decisions regarding the upbringing and control of the student through 3 

procedures encouraging students to discuss mental or physical health or life 4 

issues with their parents or through facilitating the discussion with their parents.  5 

(5) (a) The Kentucky Board of Education or the Kentucky Department of 6 

Education shall not require or recommend that a local school district keep 7 

any student information confidential from a student's parents. A district or 8 

school shall not adopt policies or procedures with the intent of keeping any 9 

student information confidential from parents. 10 

(b) The Kentucky Board of Education or the Kentucky Department of 11 

Education shall not require or recommend policies or procedures for the 12 

use of pronouns that do not conform to a student's biological sex as 13 

indicated on the student's original, unedited birth certificate issued at the 14 

time of birth pursuant to KRS 156.070(2)(g)2. 15 

(c) A local school district shall not require school personnel or students to use 16 

pronouns for students that do not conform to that particular student's 17 

biological sex as referenced in paragraph (b) of this subsection. 18 

(d) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a school district or district 19 

personnel from withholding information from a parent if a reasonably 20

abused or neglected child as defined in KRS 600.020. The fact that district 23 

personnel withhold information from a parent under this subsection shall 24 

not in itself constitute evidence of failure to report dependency, neglect, or 25 

abuse to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services under KRS 620.030. 26 

(6) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a school district or district personnel from 27
