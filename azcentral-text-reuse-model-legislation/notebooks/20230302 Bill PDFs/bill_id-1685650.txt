CHAPTER 6614
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS15

33-6601. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that:16
(1) There are real and inherent physical differences between men and17

women;18
(2) Every person has a natural right to privacy and safety in restrooms19

and changing facilities where such person might be in a partial or full state20
of undress in the presence of others;21

(3) This natural right especially applies to students using public22
school restrooms and changing facilities where student privacy and safety is23
essential to providing a safe learning environment for all students;24

(4) Requiring students to share restrooms and changing facilities with25
members of the opposite biological sex generates potential embarrassment,26
shame, and psychological injury to students, as well as increasing the like-27
lihood of sexual assault, molestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism;28

(5) Providing separate public school restrooms and changing facilities29
for the different biological sexes is a long-standing and widespread prac-30
tice protected by federal law, state law, and case law;31

(6) Federal legislative action, federal executive action, and fed-32
eral court judgments that prevent public schools from maintaining separate33
restrooms and changing facilities for different biological sexes are in-34
consistent with the United States constitution and violate the privacy and35
safety rights of students; and36

(7) A statewide policy ensuring separate school restrooms and chang-37
ing facilities on the basis of biological sex is substantially related to the38
important governmental interest in protecting the privacy and safety of all39
students.40
