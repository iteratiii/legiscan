1.  Hormone therapy; or 

2.  Puberty blocking drugs, unless such drugs are medically 

necessary.  For the purpose of this paragraph, a gender transition 

shall not constitute medical necessity. 

B.  If a person received hormone therapy or a puberty blocking 

drug while such person was under eighteen (18) years of age and if 

the hormone therapy or puberty blocking drug caused the person to 

not be able to enjoy the natural reproductivity functions of child 

bearing and rearing that the person would have enjoyed if not for 

the hormone therapy or puberty blocking drug, the person may bring 

an action against his or her parent or legal guardian who consented 

to the hormone therapy or puberty blocking drug on behalf of the 

minor. 

C.  If the person is under eighteen (18) years of age, he or she 

may bring an action: 

1.  Throughout their minority through a parent or legal 

guardian, provided that the parent or legal guardian is not the same 

parent or legal guardian who consented to hormone therapy or a 

puberty blocking drug on behalf of the minor; and 

2.  In their own name upon reaching majority. 

D.  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall 

be no time limitation for the commencement of an action brought 

under this section except as provided by this subsection.
