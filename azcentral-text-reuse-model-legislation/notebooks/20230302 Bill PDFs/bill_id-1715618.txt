of this act; that the cabinet-level transfer revises the duties of the 3 

Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education as it currently exists 4 

within the Department of Human Services; that the cabinet-level department 5 

transfer impacts the expenses and operations of state government; and that it 6 

is necessary for the protection of the health, welfare, and safety of 7 

children who are affected by the division's programs and services that this 8

year to coincide with the budgeting functions of the Department of Human 10 

Services and Department of Education and ensure continuity of services; that 11 

Section 63 of this act creates new funds to be administered by the Department 12 

of Education; that the funds created to implement various provisions of this 13

exist, and Sections 58 and Sections 60-70 of this act being necessary for the 17 

preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective 18 

on July 1, 2023. 19 

 (c)  It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of 20 

Arkansas that Sections 7, 9-10, 22, 32-34, 36, 43, and 45 concern The Teacher 21 

Fair Dismissal Act of 1983, § 6-17-1501 et seq., and the Public School 22 

Employee Fair Hearing Act, § 6-17-1701 et seq.; that these provisions of law 23 

directly affect existing public school employees who are employed by public 24 

school districts under written annual contracts; that public school 25 

employees' written annual contracts are in effect through the end of the 26 

current school year; that in order to avoid affecting current public school 27 

employees' contracts with public school districts, these provisions of law 28 

must go into effect on a certain date, which corresponds with the end of the 29 

2022-2023 school year and the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year; that 30 

provisions of this act are immediately necessary to ensure that contracts 31 

entered into between public school districts and public school employees for 32 

the upcoming 2023-2024 school year, which are currently being negotiated, 33 

account for the correct provisions of state law in order to provide essential 34 

educational services to public school students in kindergarten through grade 35 

twelve (K-12) in the State of Arkansas and ensure that public school 36
