collusive activity; defining terms; prohibiting 

certain government entities from entering into 

certain contracts; specifying violative contractual

BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA: 

SECTION 1.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 9301 of Title 74, unless there 

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

The Legislature finds that: 

1.  Numerous essential American industries—including fossil fuel 

production, agriculture, timber production, and firearms—are being 

targeted for boycotting, divesting, and sanctioning by large 

corporations and public and private institutional investors;

 2.  The goal of these colluding parties is to starve targeted 

legal industries of capital, restrict their productivity, and 

redirect that capital to favored industries; 

3.  These parties are working in concert with many state and 

federal lawmakers and regulators, as evidenced most recently by new 

climate disclosure rules from the United States Securities and 

Exchange Commission; 

4.  Restricting the supply of energy and other essential 

commodities, without effective substitutes for those commodities, 

only serves to raise prices on consumers, profoundly impacting the 

poorest among us; 

5.  Denying financing to American companies, who are among the 

most socially and environmentally responsible companies in the 

world, only serves to support hostile nations and less responsible 

producers; 

6. Banks and insurance companies are increasingly denying 

financing to creditworthy companies to market their environmental 

credentials to the detriment of consumers, shareholders and society; 

7.  Institutional investors are divesting from entire industries 

and pressuring corporations to commit to environmental goals, such 

as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, to burnish 

their environmental credentials or promote their own environmental, 

social, and governance funds at the expense of investor returns;

 8.  Large investment firms, through their proxy votes on 

shareholder resolutions and board elections, are colluding to force 

companies to direct money, time, and attention away from their core 

responsibility of increasing shareholder returns, driving capital 

allocation decisions and political change outside the democratic 

process; 

9.  Corporations are boycotting and sanctioning essential legal 

industries, such as fossil fuel and agriculture producers, by 

denying them capital, refusing to provide them with products or 

services or imposing undue burdens on them; 

10.  The collusion of corporations, and institutions to boycott, 

divest from, or sanction any industry may violate existing antitrust 

and fiduciary duty laws and harms consumers, shareholders, and this 

state; and 

11.  States, when financially prudent, should avoid doing 

business with companies that engage in such potentially illegal 

conduct, and threaten harm to this state, its businesses, and 

citizens. 

SECTION 2.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 9302 of Title 74, unless there 

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:

reports, letters to clients, communications with portfolio 

companies, statements of principles, or commitments, or 

participation in, affiliation with, or status as a signatory to, any 

coalition, initiative, joint statement of principles, or agreement; 

4.  "Economic boycott" means, without an ordinary business 

purpose, refusing to deal with, terminating business activities
