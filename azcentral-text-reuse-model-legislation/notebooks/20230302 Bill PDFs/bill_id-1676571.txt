A BILL FOR AN ACT

Relating to procedures to alter minor’s sex; and declaring an emergency.

Whereas Oregon has a compelling governmental interest in protecting the health and safety of

its residents, especially vulnerable children; and

Whereas only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress related to a

fixation on the reality of their sex; and

Whereas according to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to

0.014 percent of adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent of adult females; and

Whereas studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who experience

distress related to a fixation on the reality of their sex come to accept their sex in adolescence or

adulthood; and

Whereas scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress related to a fixation

on the reality of their sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these

individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services; and

Whereas suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities and mortality rates remain markedly elevated

above the background population after inpatient sex alteration procedures have been performed; and

Whereas some health care providers are prescribing drugs in order to delay the onset or

progression of normally timed puberty in children who experience distress related to a fixation on

the reality of their sex, despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks

and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress; and

Whereas health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who expe-

rience distress related to a fixation on the reality of their sex, despite the fact that no randomized

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in

adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress; and

Whereas the use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks, including, for females,

erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,

hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers and irreversible infertility, and for males,

thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular

disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer and irreversible infertility; and

Whereas genital and nongenital modification, amputation and mutilation surgeries are generally

not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to undergo such

surgeries are becoming more frequent; and

Whereas genital modification, amputation and mutilation surgeries include several irreversible

invasive procedures for both males and females and involve alterations of biologically normal and

functional body parts, including, for males, surgery that may involve genital mutilation including

penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty and vulvoplasty, and for females, surgery that

may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, genital mutilation in-

cluding metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty and implantation of erection or

testicular prostheses; and

Whereas the complications, risks and long-term care concerns associated with genital modifica-

tion, amputation and mutilation surgeries for both males and females are numerous and complex;

and

Whereas nongenital surgeries include various invasive procedures for males and females and

also involve the modification, amputation and mutilation of biologically normal and functional body

parts, including, for males, procedures such as augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization sur-

gery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair

reconstruction and other aesthetic procedures, and for females, procedures such as subcutaneous

mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants and other aesthetic procedures;

and

Whereas it is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or

product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases, and just between

2015 and 2016, sex alteration surgeries increased by 20 percent; and

Whereas it is of grave concern to Oregonians that the medical community is allowing individ-

uals who experience distress related to a fixation on the reality of their sex to be subject to irre-

versible and drastic nongenital surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital modification,

amputation and mutilation surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such

extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and

Whereas the risks of these procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study

on these procedures; now, therefore,

Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:
