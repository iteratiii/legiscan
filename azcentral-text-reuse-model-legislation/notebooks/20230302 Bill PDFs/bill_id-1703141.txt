company continues to engage in ideological boycotts, the board shall sell, 
redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the financial 
company,  except  securities  described  by  section  11,  and  amendments 
thereto,  according  to  the  schedule  provided  by  section  10,  and 
amendments thereto.

New Sec. 10. (a) When the board is required to sell, redeem, divest or 
withdraw all publicly traded securities of a listed financial company, the 
board shall comply with the following schedule:

(1) At least 50% of those assets shall be removed from the system's 
assets under management not later than the 180th day after the date the 
financial  company  receives  notice  under  section  9,  and  amendments 
thereto, or subsection (b) unless the board determines that a later date is 
more  prudent,  based  on  a  good  faith  exercise  of  the  board's  fiduciary 
discretion and subject to paragraph (2); and

(2) 100% of such assets shall be removed from the system's assets 
under management not later than the 360th day after the date the financial

resumes such financial company's boycott, the board shall send a written 
notice to the financial company informing such financial company that the 
board will sell, redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly traded securities of 
the financial company according to the schedule in subsection (a).

(c) Except as provided by subsection (a),  the board may delay the 
schedule for divestment under such subsection only to the extent that the 
board determines, in the board's good faith judgment and consistent with 
the board's fiduciary duty, that divestment from listed financial companies 
will likely result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation as provided 
by section 12(b), and amendments thereto. If the board delays the schedule 
for  divestment,  the  board  shall  submit  a  report  to  the  treasurer,  the

fund or create a similar actively or passively managed fund with indirect 
holdings  devoid  of  listed  financial  companies.  If  a  manager  creates  a 
similar  fund  with  substantially  the  same  management  fees  and 
substantially the same level of investment risk and anticipated return, the 
board  may  replace  all  applicable  investments  with  investments  in  the 
similar fund in a time frame consistent with prudent fiduciary standards 
but  not  later  than the 450th day after  the date the fund is  created.  If  a

the hypothetical value of all assets under management by the system as a 
result of having to divest from listed financial companies under this act; or

(2) an  individual  portfolio  that  uses  a  benchmark-aware  strategy 
would be subject to an aggregate expected deviation from its benchmark of 
greater  than  25% as  a  result  of  having  to  divest  from listed  financial 
companies under this act.

(c) The board may cease divesting from a listed financial company as 
provided by this section only to the extent necessary to ensure that  the 
system does not suffer a loss in value or deviate from its benchmark as 
described by subsection (b).

(d) Before  the  board  may  cease  divesting  from  a  listed  financial 
company under this section, the board shall provide a written report to the 
treasurer,  the  president  of  the  senate,  the  speaker  of  the  house  of 
representatives  and  the  attorney  general  stating  the  reason  and 
justification, supported by clear and convincing evidence, for deciding to 
cease divestment or to remain invested in a listed financial company.

(e) The  board  shall  update  the  report  required  by  subsection  (d)

(4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement 
to commit,  or  by any concerted action committing,  any act  of  boycott,

intimidation monopolizing or  attempting to monopolize any part  of the 
business of insurance.

(5) False  statements  and  entries. (a)  Knowingly  filing  with  any 
supervisory  or  other  public  official,  or  knowingly  making,  publishing, 
disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before

amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract 
of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in 
any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner 
whatever.

(c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the  amount,  extent  or  kind  of  coverage  available  to  an  individual,  or 
charging  an  individual  a  different  rate  for  the  same  coverage  solely 
because  of  blindness  or  partial  blindness.  With  respect  to  all  other 
conditions,  including  the  underlying  cause  of  the  blindness  or  partial 
blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the 
same  standards  of  sound  actuarial  principles  or  actual  or  reasonably 
anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes 
denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that 
the policy defines  "disability"  as  being presumed in  the  event  that  the 
insured loses  such  person's  eyesight.  However,  an insurer  may exclude 
from  coverage  disabilities  consisting  solely  of  blindness  or  partial 
blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

(d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health 
and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a 
different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for 
losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based 
on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or 
may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
(d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined 
in  K.S.A.  60-3102,  and amendments  thereto,  between  family members, 
current  or  former  household  members,  or  current  or  former  intimate 
partners.

(i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health 
insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may 
be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek 
medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse, 
protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.

(ii) Nothing in  this  section shall  be construed to prohibit  a person 
from  declining  to  issue  an  insurance  policy  insuring  the  life  of  an 
individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if 
the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the 
insurance policy.

(iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an 
individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall 
be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered 
by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.

(iv) No person  shall  refuse  to  insure,  refuse to  continue  to  insure,

limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or 
charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or 
mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is 
based on sound actuarial principles.

(v) Nothing in  this  section shall  be construed to  prohibit  a  person 
from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or 
mental  condition,  even  if  such  condition  has  been  caused  by  abuse, 
provided that:

(A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the 
same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim 
of abuse;

(B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of 
abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and

(C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this 
section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.

(vi) Any  person  who  underwrites  or  rates  a  risk  on  the  basis  of 
preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
(v),  shall  treat  such  underwriting  or  rating  as  an  adverse  underwriting 
decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.

(vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life 
and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective 
date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the 
effective date of this act.

(e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an 
individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage, 
solely because of such individual's  status as a living organ donor.  With 
respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall 
be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or 
reasonably  anticipated  experience  as  are  persons  who  are  not  organ 
donors.

(8) Rebates. (a)  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  by  law, 
knowingly permitting,  offering to  make or  making any contract  of  life 
insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to 
such  contract  other  than  as  plainly expressed  in  the  insurance  contract 
issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give, 
directly or  indirectly,  as  inducement  to  such insurance,  or  annuity,  any 
rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage 
in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or 
inducement  whatever  not  specified  in  the  contract;  or  giving,  selling, 
purchasing or  offering to  give,  sell  or  purchase as  inducement  to  such 
insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds 
or  other  securities  of  any  insurance  company  or  other  corporation,

association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or 
anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.

(b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including 
within  the  definition  of  discrimination  or  rebates  any of  the  following 
practices:

(i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying 
bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or 
in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any 
such  bonuses  or  abatement  of  premiums shall  be  fair  and  equitable  to 
policyholders  and  for  the  best  interests  of  the  company  and  its 
policyholders;

(ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit 
plan,  making  allowance  to  policyholders  who  have  continuously  for  a 
specified  period  made  premium  payments  directly  to  an  office  of  the 
insurer  in  an  amount  that  fairly  represents  the  saving  in  collection 
expenses; or

(iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy 
based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first 
or  any  subsequent  policy  year  of  insurance  thereunder,  which  may be 
made retroactive only for such policy year.

(9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement 
practice if  any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining 
thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such 
provisions,  or  committed  with  such  frequency  as  to  indicate  a  general 
business practice:

(a) Misrepresenting  pertinent  facts  or  insurance  policy  provisions 
relating to coverages at issue;

(b) failing  to  acknowledge  and  act  reasonably  promptly  upon 
communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;

(c) failing  to  adopt  and  implement  reasonable  standards  for  the 
prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies;

(d) refusing  to  pay  claims  without  conducting  a  reasonable 
investigation based upon all available information;

(e) failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable 
time after proof of loss statements have been completed;

(f) not  attempting  in  good  faith  to  effectuate  prompt,  fair  and 
equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably 
clear;

(g) compelling insureds to institute litigation to recover amounts due 
under an insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amounts 
ultimately recovered in actions brought by such insureds;

(h) attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a 
reasonable person would have believed that such person was entitled by

reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made 
part of an application;

(i) attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was 
altered without notice to, or knowledge or consent of the insured;

(j) making  claims  payments  to  insureds  or  beneficiaries  not 
accompanied  by  a  statement  setting  forth  the  coverage  under  which 
payments are being made;

(k) making known to insureds or claimants a policy of appealing from 
arbitration awards  in  favor of  insureds or  claimants  for  the purpose of 
compelling  them  to  accept  settlements  or  compromises  less  than  the 
amount awarded in arbitration;

(l) delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an 
insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim 
report  and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of 
loss  forms,  both  of  which  submissions  contain  substantially  the  same 
information;

(m) failing  to  promptly  settle  claims,  where  liability  has  become 
reasonably clear,  under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in 
order to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy 
coverage; or

(n) failing to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis 
in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial 
of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement.

(10) Failure to maintain complaint  handling procedures. Failure of 
any  person,  who  is  an  insurer  on  an  insurance  policy,  to  maintain  a 
complete record of all the complaints that it has received since the date of 
its last examination under K.S.A. 40-222, and amendments thereto; but no 
such records shall be required for complaints received prior to the effective 
date of this act. The record shall indicate the total number of complaints, 
their classification by line of insurance, the nature of each complaint, the 
disposition  of  the  complaints,  the  date  each  complaint  was  originally 
received by the insurer and the date of final disposition of each complaint. 
For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  "complaint"  means  any  written 
communication primarily expressing a grievance related to the acts and 
practices set out in this section.

(11) Misrepresentation  in  insurance  applications. Making  false  or 
fraudulent statements or representations on or relative to an application for 
an  insurance  policy,  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  a  fee,  commission, 
money or other benefit from any insurer, agent, broker or individual.

(12) Statutory violations. (a) Any violation of any of the provisions of 
K.S.A. 40-216, 40-276a, 40-2,155 or 40-1515, and amendments thereto.

(b) Any violation of  the provisions of  sections 24 through 27, and  
amendments thereto.

(14) Rebates and other inducements in title insurance. (a) No title 
insurance  company  or  title  insurance  agent,  or  any  officer,  employee, 
attorney, agent or solicitor thereof, may pay, allow or give, or offer to pay, 
allow or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining any title 
insurance  business,  any  rebate,  reduction  or  abatement  of  any  rate  or 
charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance, any special favor 
or advantage not generally available to others of the same classification, or 
any money, thing of value or other consideration or material inducement. 
The  words  "charge  made  incident  to  the  issuance  of  such  insurance" 
includes, without limitations, escrow, settlement and closing charges.

(b) No insured named in a title insurance policy or contract nor any 
other person directly or indirectly connected with the transaction involving 
the  issuance  of  the  policy  or  contract,  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
mortgage  lender,  real  estate  broker,  builder,  attorney  or  any  officer, 
employee,  agent  representative or  solicitor  thereof,  or  any other  person 
may  knowingly  receive  or  accept,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  rebate, 
reduction or abatement of any charge, or any special favor or advantage or 
any monetary consideration or inducement referred to in subsection (14)

expenses.

(d) Nothing in this section prohibits the division of rates and charges 
between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or one or more

division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate under 
the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a 
finder's fee.

otherwise requires:

natural  person;  any director,  officer  or  employee  of  a  producer  of  title 
business or associate; any legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is 
under common control with a producer of title business or associate; and

of this section.

(ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or 
beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of 
the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.

type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose 
of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be 
obtained  as  a  consequence  of  that  interest  from  the  referral  of  title 
business.

(iii) "Person"  means  any  natural  person,  partnership,  association, 
cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.

(iv) "Producer  of  title  business"  or  "producer"  means  any  person, 
including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or 
capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business, 
occupation or profession of:

(A) Buying or selling interests in real property;
(B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
(C) acting as  broker,  agent,  representative or  attorney for  a person

(v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any 
power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether 
or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained 
with respect to the referral.

(f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title 
insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has 
reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of 
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the 
associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent 
to  which  business  is  referred  unless  the  producer  has  disclosed  to  the 
buyer,  seller  and  lender  the  financial  interest  of  the  producer  of  title 
business or associate referring the title insurance business.

(g) No  title  insurer  or  title  agent  may  accept  an  order  for  title 
insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any 
premium, or  charge  in  connection  with  any transaction  if:  (i)  The  title 
insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction

will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and 
(ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent 
during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in 
which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The 
prohibitions  contained  in  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply to  transactions 
involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by 
the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.

(h) Within  90  days  following  the  end  of  each  business  year,  as 
established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent 
shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which 
the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by 
the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under 
penalty of  perjury,  stating the  percent  of  closed title  orders  originating 
from controlled business.  The failure of  a title  insurer  or title  agent to 
comply  with  the  requirements  of  this  section,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
commissioner,  shall  be  grounds  for  the  suspension  or  revocation  of  a 
license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate 
any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be 
in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal 
housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.

(i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance 
order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if  it  knows or has 
reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of 
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the 
associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent 
to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing 
to the person so referred the fact that  such producer or associate has a 
financial  interest  in  the  title  insurer  or  title  agent,  the  nature  of  the 
financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges 
generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services.  Such 
disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated 
to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate 
has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers 
of  not  less  than  three  other  title  insurers  or  agents  that  operate  in  the 
county in which the property is located.  If  fewer than three insurers or 
agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers 
or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed 
by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment 
having been made to such title insurer or agent.

(2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall 
require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any 
other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract, 
lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any

interest in such title agent or title insurer.

(3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order 
or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to

shall  disclose  any  nonpublic  personal  information  contrary  to  the 
provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law 
106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to 
carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent 
with  and  not  more  restrictive  than  the  model  regulation  adopted  on 
September  26,  2000,  by  the  national  association  of  insurance 
commissioners  entitled  "Privacy  of  consumer  financial  and  health 
information regulation".

(b) Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  be  deemed  or  construed  to 
authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts, 
supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning 
requirements  for  notification  of,  or  obtaining  consent  from,  a  parent, 
guardian  or  other  legal  custodian  of  a  minor  relating  to  any  matter 
pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.

Sec. 31. K.S.A. 75-4208 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-
4208. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b),  the board shall follow the 
procedure prescribed in rules and regulations adopted under the provisions 
of  K.S.A.  75-4232,  and  amendments  thereto,  in  designating  banks  to 
receive  deposit  of  state  moneys  in  operating  accounts  and  investment 
accounts.  The  board  shall  determine  which  banks  shall  receive  state 
operating  and  investment  accounts  and  shall  designate  the  types  of 
accounts to be awarded each such bank and the initial  amount of each 
award. Such initial awards which are operating accounts shall be made as 
provided in K.S.A. 75-4205, and amendments thereto. Such initial awards 
which are investment accounts shall be awarded as is provided in K.S.A. 
75-4209, and amendments thereto. Upon making the awards provided for 
above, the board shall notify each bank of its award, and that the same is 
subject to approval of securities to be pledged as prescribed in this act.

(b) The board shall not designate a bank to receive deposit of state  
moneys in operating  accounts or investment accounts if  such bank has  
been listed by the state treasurer as a restricted  financial institution as  
provided in section 15, and amendments thereto. Any agreement awarding 
the deposit of state moneys in operating accounts or investment accounts  
for a term commencing on or after July 1, 2024, shall comply with the  
provisions of section 18, and amendments thereto.

Sec. 32. K.S.A. 75-4208 and K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 40-2404 are hereby 
repealed.

Sec. 33. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its 
publication in the statute book.
