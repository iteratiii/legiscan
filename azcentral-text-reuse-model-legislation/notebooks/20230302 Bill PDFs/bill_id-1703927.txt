AN ACT relating to adult-oriented businesses. 1 

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: 2 

SECTION 1.   A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 231 IS CREATED TO 3 

READ AS FOLLOWS: 4 

(1) The General Assembly enacts Sections 1 to 6 of this Act to regulate the location 5 

of, and access to, adult-oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, and 6 

general welfare of the citizens of this Commonwealth and to establish reasonable 7 

regulations to abate and prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult-8 

oriented businesses near sensitive land uses and locations that cater to minors. 9 

(2) It is not the purpose of Sections 1 to 6 of this Act to: 10 

(a) Impose a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access by 11 

adults to any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials, 12 

protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; 13 

(b) Deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented 14 

entertainment to their intended market; or 15 

(c) Condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 16 

(3) The General Assembly finds and declares: 17 

(a) Adult-oriented businesses, as a category of commercial use, are associated 18 

with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including crimes against 19 

persons and property, human trafficking, prostitution, potential spread of 20 

disease, lewdness, public indecency, vulgarity, weakening of public 21 

morality, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts 22 

on surrounding properties and their value, urban blight, litter, and sexual 23 

assault, trafficking, and exploitation; 24 

(b) Adult-oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to 25 

minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon these uses, and should 26 

be separated from other adult-oriented businesses to minimize the 27

secondary effects associated adult-oriented businesses and to prevent an 1 

unnecessary concentration of adult-oriented businesses in one (1) area; 2 

(c) Access to adult-oriented businesses should be limited exclusively to mentally 3 

competent adults; and 4 

(d) Each negative secondary effect described in this section constitutes a harm 5 

which the Commonwealth has a substantial government interest in 6 

preventing and abating. The Commonwealth's interest in regulating adult-7 

oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of both 8 

current and future adult-oriented businesses that may locate in the state. 9
