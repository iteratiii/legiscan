amended to read as follows:12

18-1506B. FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION OF A CHILD -- EXCLUSIONS -- PENAL-13
TIES -- DEFINITION. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4)(3) of this14
section, whoever knowingly authorizes or commits any procedure that circum-15
cises, excises, or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora,16
labia minora, or clitoris of a child shall be guilty of a felony.17

(2) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, whoever know-18
ingly gives permission for, or permits on a child, any act prohibited by sub-19
section (1) of this section shall be guilty of a felony.20

(3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, whoever know-21
ingly removes or causes, permits, or facilitates the removal of a child from22
this state for the purpose of facilitating any act prohibited by subsection23
(1) of this section shall be guilty of a felony.24

(2) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, any medical25
practitioner who knowingly engages in any of the following practices upon26
a child for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm27
the child's perception of the child's sex if that perception is inconsistent28
with the child's biological sex shall be guilty of a felony:29

(a) Performing surgeries that sterilize or mutilate, or artificially30
construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the31
child's biological sex, including castration, vasectomy, hysterec-32
tomy, oophorectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, penectomy, phal-33
loplasty, clitoroplasty, vaginoplasty, vulvoplasty, ovariectomy, or34

(ii) Supraphysiological doses of testosterone to a female; or1
(iii) Supraphysiological doses of estrogen to a male; or2

(d) Removing any otherwise healthy or nondiseased body part or tissue.3
(4) (3) A surgical operation or medical intervention shall not be a vio-4

lation of this section if the operation or intervention is:5
(a) Necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed and is6
performed by a person licensed in the place of its performance as a med-7
ical practitioner, except that a medical intervention that results in8
the impairment and mutilation of the reproductive organs and parts of a9
child is never necessary to the health of the child on whom it is per-10
formed if it is for the sole purpose of attempting to alter the appear-11
ance of or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex if that per-12
ception is inconsistent with the child's biological sex; or13
(b) Performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth and is14
performed for medical purposes connected with that labor or birth by a15
person licensed in the place it is performed as a medical practitioner,16
midwife, or person in training to become such a practitioner or midwife.17
(4) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to18

a person acting in accordance with the good faith medical decision of a par-19
ent or guardian of a child born with a medically verifiable genetic disorder20
of sex development, including:21

(a) A child with external biological sex characteristics that are am-22
biguous and irresolvable, such as a child born having 46, XX chromosomes23
with virilization, 46, XY chromosomes with undervirilization, or with24
both ovarian and testicular tissue;25
(b) When a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual de-26
velopment in which the physician has determined through genetic testing27
that the child does not have the normal sex chromosome structure, sex28
steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a male or29
female; or30
(c) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that31
has been caused or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition32
procedures, whether or not the procedures were performed in accordance33
with state and federal law.34
(5) In applying subsection (4)(3)(a) of this section, no account shall35

be taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to be performed36
or any belief on the part of that person, or any other person, that the opera-37
tion is required as a matter of custom or ritual.38

(6) Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be guilty39
of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not more40
than life ten (10) years.41

(7) For the purposes of this section, "child" means any person under42
eighteen (18) years of age.43

(8) For the purposes of this section, "sex" means the immutable biolog-44
ical and physiological characteristics, specifically the chromosomes and45
internal and external reproductive anatomy, genetically determined at con-46
ception and generally recognizable at birth, that define an individual as47
male or female.48

(9) The provisions of this act are hereby declared to be severable,49
and if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any50



3

person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration1
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this section.2

(10) The legislature finds and declares that:3
(a) Biological sex is an objectively defined category that has obvious,4
immutable, and distinguishable characteristics.5
(b) Gender dysphoria among children rarely persists into adulthood,6
with peer-reviewed research revealing that as many as ninety-eight per-7
cent (98%) of gender dysphoric boys and as many as eighty-eight percent8
(88%) of gender dysphoric girls ultimately identify with their biologi-9
cal sex after passing through puberty.10
(c) Some healthcare providers now routinely administer puberty block-11
ers to prepubescent and pubescent children notwithstanding scientific12
evidence that children who remain on puberty blockers may never recover13
lost development and despite known sterility and additional concerns14
about reduced IQ and future osteoporosis.15
(d) Some healthcare providers now routinely administer cross-sex hor-16
mones to pubescent children notwithstanding scientific evidence that17
such therapies cause irreversible sterility and likely increase risks18
of other medical conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease,19
blood clots, osteoporosis, and obesity.20
(e) Some healthcare providers now refer pubescent adolescents for sex21
reassignment surgeries that permanently mutilate healthy reproductive22
organs and other body parts.23
(f) The world professional association for transgender health, a pro-24
fessional organization that publishes the standards of care for treat-25
ing gender dysphoria, has altogether removed its age recommendations26
for adolescent sex reassignment surgeries, including but not limited to27
surgical castration, mastectomies, hysterectomies, and genital recon-28
struction, despite the known harms and experimental nature of perform-29
ing such surgeries on gender dysphoric children.30
(g) Recent science suggests that medical interventions like surgeries31
and cross-sex hormones do not significantly improve long-term health32
outcomes for patients struggling with gender dysphoria and that suicide33
rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly34
elevated above the background population after inpatient gender reas-35
signment procedures have been performed.36
(h) No long-term randomized studies evaluate the efficacy or safety of37
the use of puberty blockers for the purpose of treating gender dyspho-38
ria, and no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the effi-39
cacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for40
the purpose of treating gender dysphoria.41
(i) These experimental, irreversible, and medically unnecessary phar-42
maceutical and surgical interventions violate the Hippocratic oath,43
taken by physicians for millennia, to "do no harm."44
(j) Therefore, the state of Idaho has a compelling government interest45
in protecting the health and safety of its minor children from such med-46
ical interventions for the purpose of attempting to affirm or change a47
child's gender expression.48

SECTION 2. That Section 19-5307, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby49
amended to read as follows:50

19-5307. FINES IN CASES OF CRIMES OF VIOLENCE. (1) Irrespective of any1
penalties set forth under state law, and in addition thereto, the court, at2
the time of sentencing or such later date as deemed necessary by the court,3
may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) against any4
defendant found guilty of any felony listed in subsections (2) and (3) of5
this section.6

The fine shall operate as a civil judgment against the defendant and7
shall be entered on behalf of the victim named in the indictment or infor-8
mation, or the family of the victim in cases of homicide or crimes against9
children, and shall not be subject to any distribution otherwise required10
in section 19-4705, Idaho Code. The clerk of the district court may collect11
the fine in the same manner as other fines imposed in criminal cases are12
collected and shall remit any money collected in payment of the fine to the13
victim named in the indictment or information or to the family of the victim14
in a case of homicide or crimes against minor children, provided that none15
of the provisions of this section shall be construed as modifying the provi-16
sions of chapter 6, title 11, Idaho Code, chapter 10, title 55, Idaho Code, or17

Code, nor shall such an order of restitution or order of compensation en-24
tered in accordance with section 72-1018, Idaho Code, be offset by the entry25
of such fine.26

A defendant may appeal a fine created under this section in the same man-27
ner as any other aspect of a sentence imposed by the court. The imposition of28
a fine created under this section shall not preclude the victim from seeking29
any other legal remedy; provided that in any civil action brought by or on be-30
half of the victim, the defendant shall be entitled to offset the amount of31
any fine imposed pursuant to this section against any award of punitive dam-32
