relating to regulation of hospitals and related institutions, so as to prohibit certain surgical2

procedures for the treatment of gender dysphoria in minors from being performed in3

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:10

SECTION 1.11

The General Assembly finds that:12

(1)  There has been a massive unexplained rise in diagnoses of gender dysphoria among13

children over the past ten years, with most of those experiencing this phenomenon being14

girls;15

(2)  Gender dysphoria is often comorbid with other mental health and developmental16

conditions, including autism spectrum disorder;17

(3)  A significant portion of children with gender dysphoria do not persist in their gender18

dysphoric conditions past early adulthood;19

(4)  Certain medical treatments for gender dysphoria, such as surgeries, have permanent20

and irreversible effects on children;21

(5)  No large-scale studies have tracked people who received gender-related medical care22

as children to determine how many remained satisfied with their treatment as they aged23

and how many eventually regretted transitioning; on the contrary, the General Assembly24

is aware of statistics showing a rising number of such individuals who, as adults, have25

regretted undergoing such treatment and the permanent physical harm it caused;26

(6)  Under the principle of "do no harm," taking a wait-and-see approach to minors with27

gender dysphoria, providing counseling, and allowing the child time to mature and28

develop his or her own identity is preferable to causing the child permanent physical29

damage; and30

(7)  The General Assembly has an obligation to protect children, whose brains and31

executive functioning are still developing, from undergoing unnecessary and irreversible32

medical treatment.33

SECTION 2.34

Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to35

regulation of hospitals and related institutions, is amended by adding a new Code section to36
