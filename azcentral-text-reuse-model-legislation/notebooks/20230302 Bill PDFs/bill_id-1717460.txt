e. [5.] For ten (10) years beginning with the combined group's first 2 

taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2024, a combined 3 

group shall be entitled to a deduction from the combined group's 4 

entire net income equal to one-tenth (1/10) of the amount 5 

necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability, 6 

decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a 7 

net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. The increase in 8 

the net deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset, 9 

or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net 10 

deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that 11 

would result from the imposition of the combined reporting 12 

requirement under KRS 141.202, but for the deduction provided 13 

under this subparagraph[paragraph] as of June 27, 2019. 14 

f.[6.] The deferred tax impact determined in subdivision 15 

e.[subparagraph 5.] of this subparagraph[paragraph] shall be 16 

converted to the annual deferred tax deduction amount, as follows: 17 

i.[a.] The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph 5. of 18 

this paragraph shall be divided by the tax rate determined 19 

under KRS 141.040; 20 

ii.[b.] The resulting amount shall be further divided by the 21 

apportionment factor determined by KRS 141.120 or 22 

141.121 that was used by the combined group in the 23 

calculation of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax 24 

liabilities as described in subdivision e.[subparagraph 5.] of 25 

this subparagraph[paragraph]; and 26 

iii[c.] The resulting amount represents the total net deferred tax 27

deduction available over the ten (10) year period as 1 

described in subparagraph 5. of this paragraph. 2 

g.[7.] The deduction calculated under this subdivision[paragraph] shall 3 

not be adjusted as a result of any events happening subsequent to 4 

the calculation, including but not limited to any disposition or 5 

abandonment of assets. The deduction shall be calculated without 6 

regard to the federal tax effect and shall not alter the tax basis of 7 

any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the 8 

combined group's entire Kentucky net income, any excess 9 

deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction to 10 

the combined group's entire net income in future taxable years 11 

until fully utilized. 12 

h.[8.] Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this 13 

subdivision[paragraph] shall file a statement with the department on or 14 

before July 1, 2019. The statement shall specify the total amount of the 15 

deduction which the combined group claims on the form, including 16 

calculations and other information supporting the total amounts of the 17 

deduction as required by the department. No deduction shall be allowed 18 

under this subdivision[paragraph] for any taxable year, except to the 19 

extent claimed on the timely filed statement in accordance with this 20 

subdivision[paragraph]: and 21 

(b) Adding to gross income any deduction directly or indirectly related to the 22 

provision of gender transition services as defined in Section 1 of this Act for 23 

a person under the age of eighteen (18) years. 24
