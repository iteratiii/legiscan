mail,  transmit,  publish,  distribute,  present,  exhibit  or  advertise  such

SB 149 2

acts  which  constitute  promoting  obscenity  or  promoting  obscenity  to 
minors  shall  be  considered  a  conviction  of  promoting  obscenity  or 
promoting obscenity to minors for the purpose of determining the number 
of prior convictions and the classification of the crime under this section.

(d) Upon  any  conviction  of  promoting  obscenity  or  promoting 
obscenity  to  minors,  the  court  may require,  in  addition  to  any fine  or 
imprisonment  imposed,  that  the  defendant  enter  into  a  reasonable 
recognizance with good and sufficient surety, in such sum as the court may 
direct,  but  not  to  exceed  $50,000,  conditioned  that,  in  the  event  the 
defendant is convicted of a subsequent offense of promoting obscenity or 
promoting obscenity to minors within two years after such conviction, the 
defendant shall forfeit the recognizance.

(e) Evidence that materials or devices were promoted to emphasize 
their prurient appeal shall be relevant in determining the question of the 
obscenity  of  such  materials  or  devices.  There  shall  be  a  rebuttable 
presumption that a person promoting obscene materials or obscene devices 
did so knowingly or recklessly if:

(1) The  materials  or  devices  were  promoted  to  emphasize  their 
prurient appeal; or

(2) the  person  is  not  a  wholesaler  and  promotes  the  materials  or 
devices in the course of the person's business.

(f) As used in this section:
(1) Any material or performance is "obscene" if:
(A) The average person applying contemporary community standards 

would find that the material or performance, taken as a whole, appeals to 
the prurient interest;

(B) the average person applying contemporary community standards 
would  find  that  the  material  or  performance  has  patently  offensive 
representations or descriptions of:

(i) Ultimate  sexual  acts,  normal  or  perverted,  actual  or  simulated, 
including sexual intercourse or sodomy; or

(ii) masturbation, excretory functions, sadomasochistic abuse or lewd 
exhibition of the genitals; and

(C) taken as a whole, a reasonable person would find that the material 
or  performance  lacks  serious  literary,  educational,  artistic,  political  or 
scientific value;

(2) "drag performance" means a performance in which one or more 
performers:

(A) Exhibits a gender identity that is different from the performer's  
gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup or other accessories that  
are traditionally worn by members of and are meant to exaggerate the  
gender identity of the performer's opposite sex; and 

(B) sings,  lip-synchs,  dances  or  otherwise  performs  before  an

audience of at least two persons for entertainment, whether performed for  
payment or not;

(3) "material"  means any tangible  thing which is  capable  of  being 
used or adapted to arouse interest, whether through the medium of reading, 
observation, sound or other manner;

(3)(4) "obscene device" means a device, including a dildo or artificial 
vagina,  designed or  marketed as useful  primarily for  the stimulation of 
human genital organs, except such devices disseminated or promoted for 
the purpose of medical or psychological therapy;

(4)(5) "performance" means any play, motion picture, dance or other 
exhibition performed before an audience;

(5)(6) "sexual intercourse" and "sodomy" mean the same as in K.S.A. 
2022 Supp. 21-5501, and amendments thereto; and

(6)(7) "wholesaler"  means  a  person  who  distributes  or  offers  for 
distribution obscene materials or devices only for  resale  and not to the 
consumer  and  who  does  not  manufacture,  publish  or  produce  such 
materials or devices.

(g) It shall be a defense to a prosecution for promoting obscenity and 
promoting obscenity to minors that the:

(1) Persons  to  whom  the  allegedly  obscene  material  or  obscene 
device  was  disseminated,  or  the  audience  to  an  allegedly  obscene 
performance,  consisted  of  persons  or  institutions  having  scientific, 
educational  or  governmental  justification for  possessing or  viewing the 
same;

(2) defendant is an officer, director, trustee or employee of a public 
library and the allegedly obscene material  was acquired by such library 
and was disseminated in accordance with regular library policies approved 
by its governing body; or

(3) allegedly  obscene  material  or  obscene  device  was  purchased, 
leased  or  otherwise  acquired  by  a  public,  private  or  parochial  school, 
college  or  university,  and that  such material  or  device was either  sold, 
leased, distributed or disseminated by a teacher,  instructor,  professor  or 
other  faculty  member  or  administrator  of  such  school  as  part  of  or 
incidental to an approved course or program of instruction at such school.

(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of  K.S.A.  2022 Supp. 21-5204, 
and amendments thereto, to the contrary, it shall be an affirmative defense 
to any prosecution for promoting obscenity to minors that:

(1) The  defendant  had  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  the  minor 
involved  was  18  years  old  or  over,  and  such  minor  exhibited  to  the 
defendant a draft card, driver's license, birth certificate or other official or 
apparently official document purporting to establish that such minor was 
18 years old or more; or

(2) an exhibition in a state of nudity is for a bona fide scientific or

(i) The provisions of this section and the provisions of ordinances of

projectionist  and  no personal  knowledge  of  the  contents  of  the  motion 
picture. The provisions of this section shall not exempt any projectionist or
