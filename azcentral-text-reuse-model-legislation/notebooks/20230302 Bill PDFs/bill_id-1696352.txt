sex; or 1 

    (ii)  Instill or create physiological or anatomical 2 

characteristics that resemble a sex different from the individual's 3 

biological sex, including without limitation medical services that provide 4 

puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other mechanisms to promote 5 

the development of feminizing or masculinizing features in the opposite 6 

biological sex, or genital or nongenital gender reassignment surgery 7 

performed for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender 8

   (B)  “Gender transition procedure” does not include: 10 

    (i)  Services to persons born with a medically 11 

verifiable disorder of sex development, including a person with external 12 

biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous, such as those 13 

born with 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with 14 

undervirilization, or having both ovarian and testicular tissue; 15 

    (ii)  Services provided when a physician has 16

steroid hormone action; 20 

    (iii)  The treatment of any infection, injury, 21 

disease, or disorder that has been caused by or exacerbated by the 22

transition procedure was performed in accordance with state and federal law 24 

or whether or not funding for the gender transition procedure is permissible 25 

under this subchapter; or 26 

    (iv)  Any procedure undertaken because the individual 27 

suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that 28 

would, as certified by a physician, place the individual in imminent danger 29

perceived gender or perceived sex was invariably inconsistent with the 33 

minor’s biological sex throughout the two (2) years;  34 

  (2)  To the extent that the minor suffered from a mental health 35 

concern, at least two (2) healthcare professionals, including at least one 36 



  SB199 

 

 4 2/6/2023 12:04:54 PM JLC038 

 

 

(1) mental health professional, certified in writing that the gender 1 

transition procedure was the only way to treat the mental health concern;  2 

  (3)  At least two (2) healthcare professionals, including at 3 

least one (1) mental health professional, certified in writing that the minor 4 

suffered from no other mental health concerns, including without limitation 5 

depression, eating disorders, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity 6 

disorder, intellectual disability, or psychotic disorders; and 7 

  (4)  The healthcare professional received the voluntary and 8 

informed consent of the parent or legal guardian of the minor and the minor 9 

as provided in subsection (b) of this section.  10 

 (b)  Consent to a gender transition procedure is voluntary and informed 11 

only if, at least thirty (30) days before the first treatment of the gender 12 

transition procedure and during every subsequent medical visit for treatment 13 

during the following six (6) months, the minor and the minor’s parent or 14 

legal guardian receives verbal notice and written notice in at least 14-15 

point, proportionally spaced typeface that state the following facts, 16 

verbatim: 17 

  "If your child begins one (1) of these treatments, it may 18 

actually worsen the discordance and thus increase the likelihood that your 19 

child will need additional and more serious interventions to address the 20 

worsening condition.  For example, if your child begins socially 21 

transitioning or taking puberty blockers, that treatment may significantly 22 

increase the likelihood that your child’s discordance will worsen and lead to 23 

your child eventually seeking cross-sex hormones or even surgery to remove 24 

some of your child’s body parts.  25 

  Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom have conducted systematic 26 

reviews of evidence and concluded that there is no evidence that the 27 

potential benefits of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for this 28 

purpose outweigh the known or assumed risks.  29 

  Medical authorities in Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom 30 

have since recommended psychotherapy as the first line of treatment for youth 31 

gender dysphoria, with drugs and surgeries reserved as a measure of last 32 

resort.  Medical authorities in France have advised “great caution” when 33 

prescribing hormones for gender dysphoria.  34 

  There are people who underwent gender transition treatments as 35 

minors and later regretted that decision and the physical harm that these 36 



  SB199 

 

 5 2/6/2023 12:04:54 PM JLC038 

 

 

treatments caused, and the total percentage of people who experience this 1 

regret is unknown.  Some estimate that the rate is below two percent (2%), 2 

but that estimate is based on studies done on adults who transitioned as 3 

adults or on minors who transitioned under highly restrictive and controlled 4 

conditions.  5 

  Sometimes gender transition treatments have been proposed as a 6 

way to reduce the chances of a minor committing suicide due to discordance 7 

between the minor’s sex and his or her perception, but the rates of actual 8 

suicide from this discordance remain extremely low.  Furthermore, as 9 

recognized by health authorities in Europe, there is no evidence that 10 

suicidality is caused by “unaffirmed” gender or that gender transition 11 

treatments are causally linked to a reduction in serious suicidal attempts or 12 

ideations.  13 

  For puberty blockers:  14 

  Puberty blockers are not approved for this purpose by the United 15 

States Food and Drug Administration, which is the federal agency that 16 

determines which drugs are safe and effective for humans to use.  Claims 17 

about puberty blockers’ safety and efficacy are based on their use for 18 

precocious puberty, a different condition in which normal puberty is allowed 19 

to resume once the patient reaches the appropriate age.  Studies on the 20 

benefits of using puberty blockers for gender dysphoria are notoriously weak.  21 

Puberty blockers are not fully reversible because, among other risks, puberty 22 

blockers may intensify a minor’s discordance and cause it to persist.  23 

Puberty blockers increase the risk of your child being sterilized, meaning 24 

that he or she will never be able to have children.  Puberty blockers may 25 

also cause diminished bone density for your child, increasing the risk of 26 

fracture and early osteoporosis.  Puberty blockers may also prevent your 27 

child from ever being able to engage in sexual activity or achieve orgasm for 28 

the rest of your child’s life.  There is no research on the long-term risks 29 

to minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers.  The full effects of 30 

puberty blockers on brain development and cognition are unknown.  31 

  For cross-sex hormones:  32 

  The use of cross-sex hormones in males is associated with 33 

numerous health risks, such as thromboembolic disease, including without 34 

limitation blood clots; cholelithiasis, including gallstones; coronary artery 35 

disease, including without limitation heart attacks; macroprolactinoma, which 36 



  SB199 

 

 6 2/6/2023 12:04:54 PM JLC038 

 

 

is a tumor of the pituitary gland; cerebrovascular disease, including without 1 

limitation strokes; hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of 2 

triglycerides in the blood; breast cancer; and irreversible infertility.   3 

The use of cross-sex hormones in females is associated with risks of 4 

erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; severe liver 5 

dysfunction; coronary artery disease, including without limitation heart 6 

attacks; hypertension; and increased risk of breast and uterine cancers.  7 

Once a minor begins cross-sex hormones, the minor may need to continue taking 8 

those hormones for many years and possibly for the remainder of the minor’s 9 

life.  The cost of these hormones may be tens of thousands of dollars.  If 10 

the use of cross-sex hormones leads to surgery, the total cost of 11 

transitioning may exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).  12 

  For surgical procedures:  13 

  The dangers, risks, complications, and long-term concerns 14 

associated with these types of procedures are almost entirely unknown.  There 15 

are no long-term studies on either the effectiveness or safety of these 16 

surgical procedures."  17 

 18 

 SECTION 2.  Arkansas Code Title 17, Chapter 80, Subchapter 1, is 19 

amended to add an additional section to read as follows: 20 

 17-80-122.  Preserving freedom of conscience and medical judgment for 21 

healthcare professionals. 22 

 State law shall not require, or be construed to require, a healthcare 23 

professional to perform a gender transition procedure. 24
