     163.048.  1.  As used in this section, the following  1 

terms mean: 2 

     (1)  "Athletics", any interscholastic athletic games,  3 

contests, programs, activities, exhibitions, or other  4 

similar competitions organized and provided for students; 5 

     (2)  "Sex", the two main categories of male and female  6 

into which individuals are divided based on an individual's  7 

reproductive biology at birth and the individual's genome. 8 

     2.  (1)  The general assembly hereby finds the  9 

following: 10 

     (a)  A noticeable disparity continues between the  11 

athletics participation rates of students who are male and  12 

students who are female; 13 

     (b)  Courts have recognized a legitimate and important  14 

governmental interest in redressing past discrimination  15 

against females in athletics on the basis of sex and  16 

promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the sexes  17 



 SB 39 2 

under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972  18 

(20 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq.), as amended; and 19 

     (c)  Courts have recognized that classification by sex  20 

is the only feasible classification to promote the  21 

governmental interest of providing opportunities for  22 

athletics for females. 23 

     (2)  The general assembly hereby declares that it is  24 

the public policy of this state to further the governmental  25 

interest of ensuring that sufficient opportunities for  26 

athletics remain available for females to remedy past  27 

discrimination on the basis of sex. 28 

     3.  (1)  Except as provided under subdivision (2) of  29 

this subsection, no school district or charter school shall  30 

allow any student to compete in an athletics competition  31 

that is designated for the biological sex opposite to the  32 

student's biological sex as correctly stated on the  33 

student's official birth certificate as described in  34 

subsection 4 of this section or, if the student's official  35 

birth certificate is unobtainable, another government record. 36 

     (2)  A school district or charter school may allow a  37 

female student to compete in an athletics competition that  38 

is designated for male students if no corresponding  39 

athletics competition designated for female students is  40 

offered or available. 41 

     4.  For purposes of this section, a statement of a  42 

student's biological sex on the student's official birth  43 

certificate or another government record shall be deemed to  44 

have correctly stated the student's biological sex only if  45 

the statement was: 46 

     (1)  Entered at or near the time of the student's  47 

birth; or 48 



 SB 39 3 

     (2)  Modified to correct any scrivener's error in the  49 

student's biological sex. 50 

     5.  No school district or charter school that violates  51 

subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section shall  52 

receive any state aid under this chapter or any other  53 

revenues from the state. 54 

     6.  The department of elementary and secondary  55 

education shall promulgate all necessary rules and  56 

regulations for the implementation and administration of  57 

this section.  Such rules and regulations shall ensure  58 

compliance with state and federal law regarding the  59 

confidentiality of student medical information.  Any rule or  60 

portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section  61 

536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in  62 

this section shall become effective only if it complies with  63 

and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and,  64 

if applicable, section 536.028.  This section and chapter  65 

536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with  66 

the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to  67 

delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule  68 

are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of  69 

rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after  70 

August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void. 71
