IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7
