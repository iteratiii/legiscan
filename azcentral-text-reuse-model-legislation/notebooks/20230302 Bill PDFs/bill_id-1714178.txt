HOUSE MEMORIAL 57

56TH LEGISLATURE - STATE OF NEW MEXICO - FIRST SESSION, 2023

INTRODUCED BY

Cathrynn N. Brown and Jenifer Jones and Harlan Vincent and

Andrea Reeb and Rod Montoya

A MEMORIAL

RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

BIOLOGICAL MALES AND FEMALES AND SUPPORTING THE REQUIREMENT

THAT SCHOOLS PROHIBIT BIOLOGICAL MALE PARTICIPATION ON FEMALE

ATHLETIC TEAMS.

WHEREAS, there are only two biological sexes:  male and

female; and

WHEREAS, a person's biological sex is determined at

fertilization and revealed in utero or at birth; and

WHEREAS, biological differences between males and females

are genetically determined; and

WHEREAS, characteristic anatomical differences and

distinct body types exist between males and females; and

WHEREAS, in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515

(1966), the United States supreme court explained that there

are "inherent differences between men and women" and these

differences "remain cause for celebration, but not for

denigration of members of either sex or for artificial

constraints on an individual's opportunity"; and

WHEREAS, males have typically scored higher than females

on tests of endurance, speed and strength, and males have

larger body sizes, more skeletal muscle mass, lower body fat

percentages and higher delivery of anaerobic and aerobic energy

than females; and

WHEREAS, males have higher natural levels of testosterone

than females, which result in higher speed and power during

physical activity.  This leads to a sports performance gap

between males and females; and

WHEREAS, courts have recognized that the inherent,

physiological differences between males and females result in

different athletic capabilities.  In Kleczek v. Rhode Island

Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992),

the Rhode Island supreme court recognized that "because of

innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not

similarly situated as they enter athletic competition".  In

Petrie v. Illinois High School Association, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861

(Ill. App. Ct. 1979), the Illinois court of appeals recognized

that "high school boys [generally possess physiological

advantages] over their girl counterparts" and that those

advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports,

like high school track; and

WHEREAS, the benefits of natural testosterone provided to

male athletes are not diminished through the use of

testosterone suppression;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO that it be requested

to support maintaining separate sex-specific teams because such

separation promotes sex equality by providing opportunities for

female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength and

athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities

to obtain recognition, accolades, college scholarships and

numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in

athletic endeavors.
