Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

result in the revocation of the medical practitioner's license,13

certification, or registration within fourteen days after receipt of the14

complaint.15

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must pay the17

medical practitioner an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars18

for each day the complaint is not provided to the medical practitioner19

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14
