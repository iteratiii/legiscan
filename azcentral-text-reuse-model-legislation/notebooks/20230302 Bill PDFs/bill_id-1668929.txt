 H.  To the extent the state or any private party is enjoined 

from enforcing any part or application of this act, all other parts 

or applications of that subsection and all other subsections are 

severable and enforceable.  It is the Legislature's intent that any

enforceable no matter the number of subsections, parts of 

subsections, or applications deemed unenforceable.  Under no 

circumstance should a court conclude the Legislature intended that 

the state or private party be enjoined from enforcing any 

subsection, application, or part of a subsection not deemed 

independently unenforceable.
