entities, or governmental entities arising out of a parcel 195 

owner's appearance and presentation before a governmental entity 196 

on matters related to the homeowners' association. However, it 197

business organizations, and individuals not engage in SLAPP 199

suits because such actions are inconsistent with the right of 200 

parcel owners to participate in the state's institutions of 201 

government. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that 202 

prohibiting such lawsuits by governmental entities, business 203 

entities, and individuals against parcel owners who address 204 

matters concerning their homeowners' association will preserve 205 

this fundamental state policy, preserve the constitutional 206 

rights of parcel owners, and assure the continuation of 207 

representative government in this state. It is the intent of the 208 

Legislature that such lawsuits be expeditiously disposed of by 209 

the courts. 210

organization, or individual in violation of this section has a 212 

right to an expeditious resolution of a claim that the suit is 213 

in violation of this section. A parcel owner may petition the 214 

court for an order dismissing the action or granting final 215 

judgment in favor of that parcel owner. The petitioner may file 216 

a motion for summary judgment, together with supplemental 217 

affidavits, seeking a determination that the governmental 218 

entity's, business organization's, or individual's lawsuit has 219 

been brought in violation of this section. The governmental 220 

entity, business organization, or individual shall thereafter 221 

file its response and any supplemental affidavits. As soon as 222 

practicable, the court shall set a hearing on the petitioner's 223 

motion, which shall be held at the earliest possible time after 224

sued by the governmental entity, business organization, or 227 

individual actual damages arising from the governmental 228 

entity's, individual's, or business organization's violation of 229 

this section. A court may treble the damages awarded to a 230 

prevailing parcel owner and shall state the basis for the treble 231 

damages award in its judgment. The court shall award the 232 

nonmoving prevailing party reasonable attorney attorney's fees 233 

and costs incurred in connection with a claim that an action was 234 

filed in violation of this section if the nonmoving party 235 

prevails on a motion filed under this section. 236

Statutes, is amended to read: 238

another person in violation of this section has a right to an 242

order dismissing the action or granting final judgment in favor 245 

of that person or entity. The person or entity may file a motion 246 

for summary judgment, together with supplemental affidavits, 247

shall be held at the earliest possible time after the filing of 253 

the claimant's or governmental entity's response. The court may 254 

award, subject to the limitations in s. 768.28, the party sued 255 

by a governmental entity actual damages arising from a 256 

governmental entity's violation of this section. The court shall 257 

award the nonmoving prevailing party reasonable attorney fees 258 

and costs incurred in connection with a claim that an action was 259

 Section 12.  If any provision of this act or the 262 

application thereof to any person or circumstance is held 263 

invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or 264 

applications of this act which can be given effect without the 265 

invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions 266 

of this act are severable. 267
