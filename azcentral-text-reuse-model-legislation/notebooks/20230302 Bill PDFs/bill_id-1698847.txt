(b) "Parent" means a biological parent of a child, an adoptive parent of a 8 

child, or an individual who has been granted legal authority over the 9 

welfare of a child under this state's laws, but shall not include any 10 

governmental entity, organization, or any person whose authority over the 11 

child has been terminated by court order. 12 

(2) The liberty of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, healthcare, and 13 

mental healthcare of that parent's child is a fundamental right. 14 

(3) The state, any political subdivision of the state, or any other governmental entity 15 

shall not substantially burden the fundamental right of a parent to direct the 16 

upbringing, education, healthcare, and mental healthcare of that parent's child 17 

without demonstrating that the substantial burden is required by a compelling 18 

governmental interest of the highest order as applied to the parent and the child 19 

and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest. 20 

(4) All parental rights are exclusively reserved to a parent of a child without 21 

obstruction by or interference from the state, any political subdivision of the state, 22 

or any other governmental entity, including, without limitation, the following 23 

rights and responsibilities: 24

choose public, private, religious, or home schools, and the following rights 1 

as applied toward the public schools of the state: 2 

1. To make reasonable choices for the child's education as may be 3 

permitted and set forth in other statutes within public schools; and 4 

2. To access and review all school records relating to the child as set 5 

forth in the Kentucky Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, KRS 6 

160.700 to 160.730, unless prohibited by court order; 7

pursuant to a court order or collected as evidence to identify a person; 15 

(h) To consent in writing before any government entity makes a video or voice 16

2. A court proceeding; 20 

3. A forensic interview in a criminal or Cabinet for Health and Family 21

that abuse, neglect, or any criminal offense, excluding de minimis offenses, 1 

has been committed against the child by someone other than a parent, 2 

including the right to be notified if the child has been a victim of a felony as 3 

set forth in KRS 158.156, unless the incident has first been reported to law 4 

enforcement and notification of the parent would impede a law enforcement 5 

or Cabinet for Health and Family Services investigation. 6 

(5) Nothing in this section shall authorize or allow a parent to abuse or neglect a 7 

child as defined in KRS Chapter 508 or 600.020. This section does not apply to a 8 

parental action or decision that would end the life of the child or to KRS Chapter 9 

402 relating to child marriage. This section shall not prohibit a court from 10 

issuing an order that is otherwise permitted by law. 11 

(6) No employee of this state, any political subdivision of this state, any other 12 

governmental entity, or any public or private educational institution, except for 13 

law enforcement personnel who are acting in an official capacity, shall 14 

encourage or coerce a child to withhold information that is vital to a parent's 15 

ability to exercise parental rights from the child's parents, nor shall any such 16 

employee withhold from the parent information vital to maintaining the physical, 17 

emotional, or mental health of the child. This shall include information necessary 18 

for the parent to engage at the earliest stages of problem behavior. 19 

(7) Unless those rights have been legally waived or legally terminated, parents have 20 

inalienable rights that are more comprehensive than those listed in Sections 1 to 21 

4 of this Act. The protections of the fundamental right of parents to direct the 22 

upbringing, education, healthcare, and mental healthcare of their child afforded 23 

by Sections 1 to 4 of this Act are in addition to the protections provided under 24 

federal law, state law, and the state and federal constitutions. 25

regarding venereal disease, substance use disorder, contraception, pregnancy, or 23 

childbirth, all without the consent of or notification to the parent, parents, or 24 

guardian of such minor patient, or to any other person having custody of such minor 25

without the consent of the parent or legal guardian, including inducing of an 1 

abortion, prescribing any medication or performing any surgical procedure 2 

related to gender transition, or performance of a sterilization operation.[ In any 3 

such case, the physician shall incur no civil or criminal liability by reason of having 4 

made such diagnostic examination or rendered such treatment, but such immunity 5 

shall not apply to any negligent acts or omissions.] 6 

(2)[ Any physician may provide outpatient mental health counseling to any child age 7 

sixteen (16) or older upon request of such child without the consent of a parent, 8 

parents, or guardian of such child. 9 

(3)] Any qualified mental health professional, as defined by KRS 202A.011, may 10 

provide outpatient mental health counseling to any child who is age sixteen (16) or 11 

older and is an unaccompanied youth, as defined by 42 U.S.C. sec. 11434a(6), upon 12 

request of such child without the consent of a parent, parents, or guardian of such 13 

child and after a reasonable attempt to verify the minor's age and status as an 14 

unaccompanied youth. 15 

(3)[(4)] Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, and without limiting cases in 16 

which consent may be otherwise obtained or is not required, any emancipated 17 

minor or any minor who has contracted a lawful marriage or borne a child may give 18 

consent to the furnishing of hospital, medical, dental, or surgical care to his or her 19 

child or himself or herself and such consent shall not be subject to disaffirmance 20 

because of minority. The consent of the parent or parents of such married or 21 

emancipated minor shall not be necessary in order to authorize such care. For the 22 

purpose of this section only, a subsequent judgment of annulment of marriage or 23 

judgment of divorce shall not deprive the minor of his or her adult status once 24 

obtained. The provider of care may look only to the minor or spouse for payment 25

1. It is necessary to perform the health service in order to prevent death 5 

or imminent, irreparable physical injury to the child; or 6 

2. A parent or legal guardian of the child cannot be located or contacted 7 

after a reasonably diligent effort; or 8 

(b) Based in good faith with a reasonable belief supported by fact that the 9 

minor is a victim of physical, sexual, or substance abuse by a parent or 10 

guardian and that obtaining a parent's or guardian's consent would place 11 

the minor at risk of further abuse from a parent or guardian[, the risk to the 12 

minor's life or health is of such a nature that treatment should be given 13 

without delay and the requirement of consent would result in delay or denial 14 

of treatment. 15 

(6) The consent of a minor who represents that he or she may give effective consent for 16 

the purpose of receiving medical, dental, or other health services but who may not 17 

in fact do so, shall be deemed effective without the consent of the minor's parent or 18 

legal guardian, if the person rendering the service relied in good faith upon the 19 

representations of the minor]. 20 

(5)[(7)] The consent of a minor age sixteen (16) or older who represents that he or she 21 

may give effective consent for the purpose of receiving outpatient mental health 22 

counseling from a qualified mental health professional, but who may not in fact do 23 

so, shall be deemed effective without the consent of the minor's parent or legal 24 

guardian if the person rendering the service relied in good faith upon the 25 

representations of the minor after a reasonable attempt to obtain parental consent or 26 

to verify the minor's age and status as an unaccompanied youth. 27

(6)[(8)] The professional may inform the parent or legal guardian of the minor patient 1 

of any treatment given or needed where, in the judgment of the professional, 2 

informing the parent or guardian would benefit the health of the minor patient. 3 

(7)[(9)] Except as otherwise provided in this section, parents, the Cabinet for Health 4 

and Family Services, or any other custodian or guardian of a minor shall not be 5 

financially responsible for services rendered under this section unless they are 6 

essential for the preservation of the health of the minor. 7 

Section 7.   Due to the high importance of parents' ability to exercise the rights 8 

outlined in this Act to provide the upbringing of their children in the Commonwealth, an 9 

emergency is declared to exist, and this Act shall take effect upon its passage and 10 

approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming law. 11
