 (a)  The General Assembly finds that: 30 

  (1)  Faculty members, teachers, and employees of public schools 31 

and state-supported institutions of higher education do not shed their 32 

constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at work; 33

  HB1468 

 

 2 2/20/2023 3:04:45 PM TNL109 

 

 

   (A)  Students' interests in receiving informed opinions on 1 

matters of public concern; 2 

   (B)  Faculty members', teachers', and employees' rights to 3 

disseminate their own opinions; and 4 

   (C)  The public's interest in exposing our children and 5 

future leaders to different viewpoints; and 6 

  (3)  The selection and use of pronouns in classrooms, on 7 

campuses, and elsewhere is a matter of free speech and academic freedom 8 

because it communicates a message on a matter of public concern and shapes 9 

classroom discussions and debates, and is not merely an administrative or 10 

ministerial act by faculty members, teachers, and employees of public schools 11 

and state-supported institutions of higher education. 12 

 (b)  As used in this section, "school" includes: 13 

  (1)  A public school or school district; 14 

  (2)  An open-enrollment public charter school; and 15 

  (3)  A state-supported institution of higher education. 16 

 (c)  A faculty member, teacher, or other employee of a school, 17 

regardless of the scope of his or her official duties: 18 

  (1)  Is not required to use a student's or coworker's preferred 19 

pronoun when referring to the student or coworker if the preferred pronoun is 20 

not consistent with the student's or coworker's biological sex; 21 

  (2)  Is not civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for 22 

using a pronoun that is consistent with the biological sex of a person to 23 

whom the faculty member, teacher, or other employee of a school is referring, 24 

even if the pronoun is not the person's preferred pronoun; and 25 

  (3)  Shall not be subject to adverse employment action for using 26 

a pronoun that is consistent with the biological sex of a person to whom the 27 

faculty member, teacher, or other employee of a school is referring, even if 28 

the pronoun is not the person's preferred pronoun. 29 

 (d)  A person who is harmed by a violation of this section may bring a 30 

cause of action for: 31 

  (1)  Injunctive relief; 32 

  (2)  Monetary damages; 33 

  (3)  Reasonable attorney's fees and costs; and 34 

  (4)  Any other appropriate relief. 35
