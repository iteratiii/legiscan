without compliance with the requirements of the Oklahoma Open 

Meeting Act.  Within seven (7) days after the summary suspension, 

the licensee shall be notified by letter that summary suspension has 

occurred.  The summary suspension letter shall include notice of the 

date of the proposed hearing to be held in accordance with Oklahoma 

Administrative Code 485:10-11-2 and the Administrative Procedures

letter, and shall be signed by one of the Board officers. 

P.  In any proceeding in which the Board is required to serve an 

order on an individual, the Board may send such material to the 

individual’s address of record with the Board.  If the order is

indicating that it is undeliverable for any reason, and the records 

of the Board indicate that the Board has not received any change of 

address since the order was sent, as required by the rules of the 

Board, the order and any subsequent material relating to the same 

matter sent to the most recent address on file with the Board shall 

be deemed by the court as having been legally served for all 

purposes.
