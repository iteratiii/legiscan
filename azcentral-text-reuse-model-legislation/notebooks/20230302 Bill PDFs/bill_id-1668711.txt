 STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

 

1st Session of the 59th Legislature (2023) 

 

HOUSE BILL 1947 By: McCall 

 

 

 

 

 

AS INTRODUCED 

 

An Act relating to state government; creating the 

Eliminate Economic Boycotts Act; declaring 

legislative intent; defining terms; requiring written 

verification in certain contracts; prohibiting 

interference in contracts; providing for enforcement; 

providing for noncodification; providing for 

codification; and providing an effective date. 

 

 

 

 

 

BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA: 

SECTION 1.     NEW LAW     A new section of law not to be 

codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows: 

A.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Eliminate 

Economic Boycotts Act". 

B.  The State of Oklahoma finds that: 

1.  Numerous essential American industries, including fossil 

fuel production, agriculture, timber production, and firearms, are 

being targeted for boycotting, divesting, and sanctioning by large 

corporations and public and private institutional investors;

 2.  The goal of these colluding parties is to starve targeted 

legal industries of capital, restrict their productivity, and 

redirect that capital to favored industries; 

3.  These parties are working in concert with many state and 

federal lawmakers and regulators, as evidenced most recently by new 

climate disclosure rules from the United States Securities and 

Exchange Commission; 

4.  Restricting the supply of energy and other essential 

commodities, without effective substitutes for those commodities, 

only serves to raise prices on consumers, profoundly impacting the 

poorest among us; 

5.  Denying financing to American companies, who are among the 

most socially and environmentally responsible companies in the 

world, only serves to support hostile nations and less responsible 

producers; 

6.  Banks and insurance companies are increasingly denying 

financing to creditworthy companies to market their environmental 

credentials to the detriment of consumers, shareholders and society; 

7.  Institutional investors are divesting from entire industries 

and pressuring corporations to commit to environmental goals, such 

as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero (0) by 2050, to burnish 

their environmental credentials or promote their own environmental, 

social, and governance funds at the expense of investor returns;

 8.  Large investment firms, through their proxy votes on 

shareholder resolutions and board elections, are colluding to force 

companies to direct money, time, and attention away from their core 

responsibility of increasing shareholder returns, driving capital 

allocation decisions and political change outside the democratic 

process; 

9.  Corporations are boycotting and sanctioning essential legal 

industries, such as fossil fuel and agriculture producers, by 

denying them capital, refusing to provide them with products or 

services, or imposing undue burdens on them; 

10.  The collusion of corporations, and institutions to boycott, 

divest from, or sanction any industry may violate existing antitrust 

and fiduciary duty laws and harms consumers, shareholders, and this 

state; and 

11.  States, when financially prudent, should avoid doing 

business with companies that engage in such potentially illegal 

conduct, and threaten harm to this state, its businesses, and 

citizens. 

SECTION 2.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 583 of Title 74, unless there is 

created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

A.  As used in this section: 

1.  "Company" means a for-profit organization, association, 

corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited partnership,

2.  "Governmental entity" means a state agency or political

3.  "Ordinary business purpose" does not include any purpose to 

further social, political, or ideological interests.  A company may

interests based upon evidence indicating such a purpose, including,

b. participation in, affiliation with, or status as a
