1.  Interventions to suppress the development of endogenous 

secondary sex characteristics;

body with the patient’s gender identity; and

Edition.  The term does not include behavioral health care services, 

such as mental health counseling or medications to treat depression, 

anxiety, or similar disorders, provided the medication does not have 

long-term altering effects on the gender of a minor.
