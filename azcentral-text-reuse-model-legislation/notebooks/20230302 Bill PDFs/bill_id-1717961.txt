communication of messages.

(2) The board shall have the responsibility for the management of the 
fund and shall discharge the board's duties with respect to the fund solely 
in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the system for the 
exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and such member's 
beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the fund 
and  shall  invest  and  reinvest  moneys  in  the  fund  and  acquire,  retain,

investments of the fund within the limitations and according to the powers, 
duties and purposes as prescribed by this section.

(3) Moneys in the fund shall be invested and reinvested to achieve the 
investment objective which is preservation of the fund to provide benefits

standards set forth in this act. No moneys in the fund shall be invested or 
reinvested if the sole or primary an investment objective is for economic 
development or social purposes or objectives.

(4) In investing and reinvesting moneys in the fund and in acquiring, 
retaining, managing and disposing of investments of the fund, the board 
shall exercise the judgment, care, skill, prudence and diligence under the 
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and 
intelligence acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would 
use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims by 
diversifying the investments of the fund so as to minimize the risk of large 
losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, 
and not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition 
of similar funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable 
safety of their capital.

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4): 
(a) Total investments in common stock may be made in the amount of 

up to 60% of the total book value of the fund;

(iv) the  system  has  received  a  favorable  and  appropriate 
recommendation  from  a  qualified,  independent  expert  in  investment 
management or analysis in that particular type of alternative investment;

(v) the  alternative  investment  is  consistent  with  the  system's 
investment policies and objectives as provided in subsection (6);

(vi) the individual alternative investment does not exceed more than 
2.5% of the total alternative investments made under this subsection. If the 
alternative investment is made pursuant to participation by the system in a 
multi-investor  pool,  the  2.5% limitation contained  in  this  subsection is 
applied  to  the  underlying  individual  assets  of  such  pool  and  not  to 
investment  in  the  pool  itself.  The  total  of  such  alternative  investments 
made pursuant to participation by the system in any one individual multi-
investor pool shall not exceed more than 20% of the total of alternative 
investments made by the system pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in 
this subsection requires the board to liquidate or sell the system's holdings 
in  any  alternative  investments  made  pursuant  to  participation  by  the 
system in any one individual multi-investor pool held by the system on the 
effective date of this act, unless such liquidation or sale would be in the 
best  interest  of  the  members  and  beneficiaries  of  the  system  and  be 
prudent under the standards contained in this section. The 20% limitation 
contained in this subsection shall not have been violated if the total of such 
investment in any one individual multi-investor pool exceeds 20% of the 
total alternative investments of the fund as a result of market forces acting 
to increase the value of such a multi-investor pool relative to the rest of the 
system's  alternative investments;  however,  the board shall  not  invest  or 
reinvest any moneys of the fund in any such individual multi-investor pool 
until the value of such individual multi-investor pool is less than 20% of 
the total alternative investments of the fund;

(vii) the board has received and considered the investment manager's 
due diligence findings submitted to the board as required by subsection (6)
(c) (6);

(viii) prior to the time the alternative investment is made, the system 
has  in  place  procedures  and  systems  to  ensure  that  the  investment  is 
properly monitored and investment performance is accurately measured; 
and

(ix) the total of alternative investments does not exceed 15% of the 
total investment assets of the fund. The 15% limitation contained in this 
subsection  shall  not  have  been  violated  if  the  total  of  such  alternative 
investments exceeds 15% of the total investment assets of the fund, based 
on  the  fund  total  market  value,  as  a  result  of  market  forces  acting  to 
increase the value of such alternative investments relative to the rest of the 
system's investments. However, the board shall not invest or reinvest any 
moneys of the fund in alternative investments until the total value of such

alternative investments is less than 15% of the total investment assets of 
the fund based on the market value. If  the total value of the alternative 
investments exceeds 15% of the total investment assets of the fund, the 
board shall not be required to liquidate or sell the system's holdings in any 
alternative investment held by the system, unless such liquidation or sale 
would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  members  and  beneficiaries  of  the 
system and is prudent under the standards contained in this section.;

(c) for purposes of this act section, "alternative investment" includes 
a broad group of investments that are not one of the traditional asset types 
of  public  equities,  fixed  income,  cash  or  real  estate.  Alternative 
investments  are  generally  made  through  limited  partnership  or  similar 
structures, are not regularly traded on nationally recognized exchanges and 
thus are relatively illiquid, and exhibit lower correlations with more liquid 
asset  types such as stocks and bonds. Alternative investments generally 
include, but are not limited to, private equity, private credit, hedge funds, 
infrastructure,  commodities  and  other  investments which that have  the

recommendation  from  a  qualified,  independent  expert  in  investment 
management or analysis in that particular type of real estate investment;

(ii) the  real  estate  investment  is  consistent  with  the  system's 
investment policies and objectives as provided in subsection (6); and

(iii) the system has received and considered the investment manager's 
due diligence findings.

(6) (a) Subject  to  the objective set  forth  in subsection (3)  and the 
standards set  forth  in subsections (4)  and (5)  the board shall  formulate 
policies and objectives for the investment and reinvestment of moneys in 
the  fund  and  the  acquisition,  retention,  management  and  disposition of 
investments of the fund. Such policies and objectives shall include:

(a)(i) Specific asset allocation standards and objectives;
(b)(ii) establishment  of  criteria  for  evaluating  the  risk  versus  the 

potential return on a particular investment;
(c)(iii) a  requirement  that  all  investment  managers  submit  such 

manager's  due  diligence  findings  on  each  investment  to  the  board  or 
investment advisory committee for approval or rejection prior to making 
any alternative investment;

(d)(iv) a requirement that all investment managers shall immediately 
report all instances of default on investments to the board and provide the 
board with recommendations and options, including, but not  limited to, 
curing the default or withdrawal from the investment; and

objectives on an annual basis.

(7) The  board  may enter  into  contracts  with  one  or  more  persons 
whom the board determines to be qualified, whereby the persons undertake

shall be paid pursuant to rates fixed by the board subject to provisions of 
appropriation  acts  and  shall  be  based  on  specific  contractual  fee 
arrangements.  The  system shall  not  pay or  reimburse  any  expenses  of 
persons  contracted  with  pursuant  to  this  subsection,  except  that  after 
approval of the board, the system may pay approved investment related 
expenses  subject  to  provisions  of  appropriation  acts.  The  board  shall

law or, if not so fixed, as may be fixed by the board, with corporate surety 
authorized to do business in this state. Such persons contracted with the 
board pursuant to this subsection and any persons contracted with such 
persons  to  perform  the  functions  specified  in  subsection  (2)  shall  be 
deemed to be agents of the board and the system in the performance of 
contractual obligations.

(8) (a) In the acquisition or disposition of securities, the board may

managers,  or  the  written  opinion of  the  attorney general  certifying the 
legality of the securities.

(b) The board shall employ or retain qualified investment counsel or
