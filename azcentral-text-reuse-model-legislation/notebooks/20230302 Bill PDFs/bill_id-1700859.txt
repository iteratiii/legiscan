By Committee on Education

2-8

AN ACT concerning education; relating to school districts and employees 
thereof;  requiring  parental  consent  for  use  of  a  student's  pronouns; 
prohibiting schools from requiring use of an individual's pronouns over 
moral  or  religious  objections;  requiring  school  districts  to  adopt 
policies thereon.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
Section 1. (a)  An employee  or  independent  contractor  of  a  school 

district shall not knowingly address, identify or refer to a student who is 
less than 18 years of age by a pronoun that differs from the pronoun that 
aligns  with  the  student's  biological  sex  unless  the  school  district  has 
received written permission from the student's parent or guardian.

(b) A school district  shall  not  require an employee or  independent 
contractor  of  such  school  district  to  address,  identify  or  refer  to  an 
individual by a pronoun that differs from the pronoun that aligns with the 
student's  biological  sex  if  doing  so  is  contrary  to  the  employee's  or 
independent contractor's moral or religious convictions.

(c) The school board of each school district shall adopt a policy to 
implement this section.

(d) This section shall not be construed to prohibit any employee or 
independent  contractor  of  a  school  district  from  discussing  matters  of 
public concern outside such employee's or independent contractor's official 
duties.

Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its 
publication in the statute book.
