Provides that a land owner, including private owners, the State, or a unit of local government, must rope off and erect warning signs near portions of a pond, river, or lake that is reasonably accessible by persons other than the owner of the property if (1) the pond, river, or lake is within 500 feet of a residence other than the property owner's residence and (2) a majority of the water by the shore is iced over. Requires a sign to be erected every 50 feet that includes a warning drawing of an individual falling through ice and text stating, \"Warning: Thin Ice\". Provides that a county, municipality, or township, including home rule units, may not adopt ordinances regulating the roping off and signage required in a manner less restrictive than provided in the Act. Provides that a county, municipality, or township ordinance regulating the roping off and signage requirements may include, but is not limited to, regulations expanding the requirements to other, temporary bodies of water, such as drainage basins, and regulating fishing and ice skating on bodies of water where roping off and signage is required. Provides that roping off and signage is not required and may not be regulated for the portions of a pond, river, or lake that are used by livestock as a water source. Limits the concurrent exercise of home rule powers.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
