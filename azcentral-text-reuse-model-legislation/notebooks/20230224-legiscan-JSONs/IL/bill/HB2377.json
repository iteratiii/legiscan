Provides that the amount of wages that may be applied toward a judgment is limited to the lesser of 10% (rather than 15%) of gross weekly wages or the amount by which disposable earnings for a week exceed the total of 80 (rather than 45) times the State minimum hourly wage or the federal minimum hourly wage, whichever is greater. Provides that the amount of payment owed to or received by the judgment debtor under an independent contractor relationship that may be applied toward a judgment is limited to the lesser of 10% of gross weekly wages or the amount by which disposable earnings for a week exceed the total of 100 times the State minimum hourly wage or the federal minimum hourly wage, whichever is greater. Provides that when assets or income of the judgment debtor not exempt from the satisfaction of a judgment, deduction order, or garnishment are discovered, the court may order the unfreezing or return of wages or assets to the debtor under specified circumstances. Provides that a consumer debt judgment may not (rather than may) be revived and shall expire after 7 years from the date of entry. Provides that every individual is entitled to an estate of homestead to the extent in value of the modern homestead exemption (rather than $15,000) as applied to his or her interest in specified property. Defines \"modern homestead exemption\" as the greater of $260,000 and the most recently available median sales price of a home in the debtor's metropolitan statistical area or county. Expands the list of personal property that is exempt from judgment, attachment, or distress for rent, including an increase in the value of the property.
