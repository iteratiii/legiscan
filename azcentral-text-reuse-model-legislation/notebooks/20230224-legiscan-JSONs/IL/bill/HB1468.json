Requires the Department of Public Health, in consultation with specified agencies and entities, to develop guidelines for hospitals, birthing centers, medical providers, Medicaid managed care organizations, and private insurers on how to conduct a family needs assessment and create a family care plan for an infant who may exhibit clinical signs of withdrawal from a controlled substance or medication. Requires an infant's family care plan to include a family needs assessment performed by a social worker or any other appropriate and trained individual or agency. Requires a licensed health care professional or social worker to complete a family care plan that shall include supports and services to be provided to the infant and the infant's parent or caregiver. Contains provisions concerning information that must be provided under a family care plan; notice to the Department of Public Health when an infant's parent or caregiver fails to adhere to a family care plan; exceptions to a finding of nonadherence; educational materials and training for hospital employees and others on the difference between notification requirements to report the birth of a substance-exposed infant and notification requirements to report alleged child abuse and neglect; and other matters. Provides that notice to the Department of Public Health on the birth of a substance-exposed infant shall not be construed to mean that prenatal substance use is intrinsically considered child abuse or neglect. Amends the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act and the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. Removes from the definition of \"neglected child\" a newborn infant whose blood, urine, or meconium contains any amount of a controlled substance. Removes a provision requiring the Department of Children and Family Services to report to the State's Attorney whenever the Department receives a report that a newborn infant's blood contains a controlled substance. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
