Provides that any person convicted of violating provisions related to approaching, overtaking, or passing a school bus, or similar provisions of a local ordinance, shall be subject to a mandatory fine of $500 (rather than $300) for a first violation. Provides that a person who observes a violation related to approaching, overtaking, or passing a school bus or making contact with a stopped school bus may file a written or oral complaint with the county sheriff's office, and at the sheriff's discretion, the report may be transferred to the Illinois State Police or municipal police department. Requires the report to be investigated by a peace officer, and the investigating officer to contact the reporting party within 30 days to provide an update on the status or outcome of the investigation. Requires that no later than July 1, 2024, a school bus must be equipped with an extended stop arm that partially obstructs the roadway if the school bus has a route that includes a bus stop which requires a school child to cross a roadway. Establishes that each extended stop arm must be equipped with additional flashing red lights. Provides that the side extension arm must be capable of extending up to 72 inches, measured from the side of the bus to furthest part of the extension arm, and at a height not less than 36 inches from the ground. Provides that the rear extension arm must meet the same specification as the side extension arm, except that it may not extend more than 32 inches from the side of the school bus. Prohibits a driver of a motor vehicle from making contact with any portion of a stopped school bus or with a school child within 30 feet of the school bus, and the violation of such is a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine of not more than $500.
