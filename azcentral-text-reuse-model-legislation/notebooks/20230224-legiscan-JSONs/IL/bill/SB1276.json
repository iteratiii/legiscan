In the definition of \"claim of torture\": provides that it also means a third party was tortured into implicating a person for the crime for which the person was convicted; provides that it also means a witness statement was used to obtain the conviction; and removes language providing that the allegations of torture occur within a county of more than 3,000,000 inhabitants. Defines \"torture\" as: any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person; any pain or suffering that is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from that person a confession or information about a third party; any pain or suffering that is intentionally inflicted on a person for purposes of punishing a suspected act by that person; or any intimidation or coercion for any reason based on discrimination of any kind. Requires the Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission to determine the resources necessary to assess the credibility or lack thereof of each claim within 2 years after the date upon the claim was received, and to make a report of its findings to the Governor and the General Assembly. Repeals a provision providing that the Act applies to claims of torture filed not later than 10 years after the effective date of the Act (August 10, 2009). Makes conforming changes.","pending_committee_id":267,"committee":{"committee_id":267,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Executive"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-03","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":267,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Executive"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
