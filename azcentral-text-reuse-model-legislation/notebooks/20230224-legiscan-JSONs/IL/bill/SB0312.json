Provides that the Authority may release personally identifiable information to the Executive Inspector General. Provides that the Authority shall make personally identifiable information of a person available to any State or local agency, inspector general, or law enforcement agency in response to a grand jury subpoena or pursuant to an investigation. Provides that the Authority shall discard personally identifiable information within 5 years. Provides that the Authority shall make every effort, within practical business and cost constraints, to purge the personal account information of an account that is closed or terminated. Provides that in no case shall the Authority maintain personal information more than 5 years after the date an account is closed or terminated.
