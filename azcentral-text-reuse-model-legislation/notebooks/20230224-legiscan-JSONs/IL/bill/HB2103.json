Changes the definition of \"caregiver\" to include: (i) a parent, spouse, adult child, or other relative by blood or marriage who would have reason to believe, as a result of the actions, statements, or behavior of the elderly person or person with a disability, that he or she is being relied upon for providing primary and substantial assistance for physical care; and (ii) a person who has voluntarily assumed the responsibility for the care of an elderly person or person with a disability under specified circumstances. Provides that \"voluntarily assumed the responsibility for the care of an elderly person or person with a disability\" means a person has voluntarily assumed responsibility for providing primary and substantial assistance for the care of an elderly person or person with a disability if the person's conduct would lead a reasonable person to believe that failure to provide such care would adversely affect the physical health of the elderly person or person with a disability.","pending_committee_id":3302,"committee":{"committee_id":3302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Criminal"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":3302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Criminal"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
