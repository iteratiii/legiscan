Provides that a covered juvenile (any person under 18 years of age incarcerated in a correctional facility, jail, or detention facility of any kind operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice, a county, or a municipality) may be placed on an administrative hold and confined when temporarily being housed in a particular juvenile detention center or for administrative or security purposes as personally determined by the chief administrative officer. Provides that whenever a covered juvenile is on an administrative hold, the Department shall provide the covered juvenile with access to the same programs and services received by covered juveniles in the general population. Provides that any restrictions on movement or access to programs and services shall be documented and justified by the chief administrative officer.
