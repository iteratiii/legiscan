In provisions concerning Substitute Teaching Licenses, provides that if there is no licensed teacher under contract because of an emergency situation, then a district may employ a substitute teacher for no longer than 30 calendar days per each vacant position in the district if the district notifies the appropriate regional office of education within 5 business days after the employment of the substitute teacher in that vacant position (instead of employment of the substitute teacher in the emergency situation). Provides that a district may continue to employ that same substitute teacher in that same vacant position for one or more additional 30 calendar day periods if, prior to the expiration of the then-current 30 calendar day period, the district files a written request with the appropriate regional office of education for a 30 calendar day extension on the basis that the position remains vacant and the district continues to actively seek qualified candidates. Provides that each extension request shall be deemed granted unless denied in writing by the regional office of education. Provides that an emergency situation is one in which a vacancy has occurred (instead of an unforeseen vacancy has occurred) and (i) a teacher is unexpectedly unable to fulfill his or her contractual duties or (ii) teacher capacity needs of the district exceed previous indications or vacancies are unfilled due to a lack of qualified candidates, and the district is actively engaged in advertising to hire a fully licensed teacher for the vacant position (instead of (i) a teacher is unable to fulfill his or her contractual duties or (ii) teacher capacity needs of the district exceed previous indications, and the district is actively engaged in advertising to hire a fully licensed teacher for the vacant position).","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
