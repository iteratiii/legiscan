With respect to the Reading Improvement Block Grant Program, removes language that provides that the State Board of Education may distribute an amount not to exceed 2% of the moneys appropriated for the Program for the purpose of providing teacher training and re-training in the teaching of reading. Provides that if the appropriation for the Program for a given fiscal year is less than $15,000,000, then the State Board shall limit eligibility to certain school districts and shall impose additional eligibility criteria to limit the number of approved applicants to a cohort sufficient for each selected district to provide adequate training and ongoing coaching support to each teacher of students in grades K through 2 and special education teachers and evidence-based curriculum investments. Removes language that provides that programs provided with grant funds shall not replace quality classroom reading instruction. Provides that Program funds may be used for grades K through 6 to provide both evidence-based, high-quality core literacy curriculum materials that consider the unique needs of English learners for concurrent oral language practice and high-quality screening assessments designed to inform instruction in English language arts and literacy for students (instead of classroom reading materials for students). Sets forth other provisions concerning if the appropriation is less than $15,000,000 or is at least $15,000,000.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-16","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
