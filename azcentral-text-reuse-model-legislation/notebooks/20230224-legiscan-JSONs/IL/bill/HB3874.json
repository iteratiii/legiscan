Provides that no more than once every 12 months, upon a 90-day written notice, a landlord may increase the rent for a dwelling unit in which a tenant resides by a rate no greater than 15%. Provides that a landlord who temporarily removes a dwelling unit from the rental market and later relists the property for rent may only increase the rental rate charged for the unit in accordance with this Section, regardless of how long the dwelling unit is vacant. Provides that if the unit is vacant for more than 12 months, the permissible percentage change shall be calculated using the gross rental rate charged when the unit was last occupied. Provides that if a tenant is the first tenant to occupy a new dwelling unit, the 12-month period begins the first month in which the rental agreement states the tenant occupied the dwelling unit. Provides that if a new landlord purchases a dwelling or dwelling unit from a landlord with a current rental agreement, the new landlord is subject to the same restrictions as the former landlord and the new owner may only increase rent within the limits of the 12-month period previously established by the former landlord. Allows the Attorney General to enforce a violation of the Act as an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. Provides that it is an affirmative defense and counterclaim in any eviction action that the landlord has charged rent in excess of the amount allowed under the Act. Makes a corresponding change in the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
