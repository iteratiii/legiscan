Authorizes the extension of mutually agreed deadlines for the submittal of enforcement-related items. Allows notices, responses, and other items to be submitted or served on a person complained against or the Environmental Protection Agency not only by certified mail but also by personal service or a third-party commercial carrier that requires the receipt of that document to be acknowledged with the recipient's signature. Provides that, whenever a third-party commercial carrier requiring the recipient's signature is used, the date recorded by the third-party commercial carrier that the third-party commercial carrier received the item for delivery shall be deemed the date the item was submitted, and the date recorded by the third-party commercial carrier that the recipient signed for the item shall be deemed the date the item was received by the recipient. Requires records authenticated by a third-party commercial carrier to be considered competent evidence that an item was submitted or received if the item is sent by a third-party commercial carrier requiring the recipient's signature.
