Allows a petition for a stalking no contact order or civil no contact order to be filed: by a member of the Illinois National Guard or any reserve military component serving within the State who is a victim of non-consensual sexual conduct who has also received a Military Protective Order; or by the Staff Judge Advocate of the Illinois National Guard or any reserve military component serving within the State on behalf of a named victim who is a victim of non-consensual sexual conduct who has also received a Military Protective Order only after receiving consent from the victim, and requires the petition to include a statement that the victim has consented to the Staff Judge Advocate filing the petition. Provides that nothing in the Civil No Contact Order Act precludes any Illinois court from enforcing a valid protective order issued by a military tribunal. Provides that a violation of a civil no contact order, when issued by a military tribunal, shall be enforced by a criminal court when the respondent commits the crime of violation of a civil no contact order. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
