Provides that a person imprisoned in the penitentiary may, after serving 10 years or more of his or her sentence or cumulative sentences, submit a petition for sentencing review in the circuit court of the county in which he or she was originally sentenced. Provides at the sentencing review hearing the court shall consider various mitigating factors. Provides that following the hearing, the court may affirm or reduce the petitioner's sentence and may depart downward from any mandatory minimum or mandatory sentence enhancement, taking into consideration certain factors. Provides that these provisions shall operate retroactively to provide any person incarcerated for a crime or crimes committed, before the effective date of the amendatory Act, with the opportunity to file a motion for resentencing under these provisions under the terms provided in these provisions. Provides that notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, nothing in these provisions shall be construed to delay parole or mandatory supervised release consideration for petitioners who, prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act, are or will be eligible for release earlier than provided for in these provisions. Provides that the clerk of the court shall transmit copies of the petitions, any amendments to the petition, and the final orders to the Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council. Provides that the Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council shall report to the Governor and the General Assembly on the impact of resentencing motions on the prison population contingent on having sufficient reliable data to support the analysis. Provides that the report shall be filed no later than 3 years after the effective date of the amendatory Act.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
