Provides that the Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall transition pharmacy services for managed care enrollees from the State's managed care medical assistance program back to the State's traditional fee-for-service program, thereby assuming direct responsibility for all pharmacy services provided under the Article. Provides that the transition back to a fee-for-service reimbursement model for pharmacy services shall be implemented by the Department upon the expiration of any managed care contracts the Department has with managed care organizations on the effective date of the amendatory Act. Provides that, to ensure managed care enrollees do not experience an interruption in pharmacy services during the transition from managed care to fee-for-service coverage, the Department must, at a minimum, do the following: add an additional pharmacist to its staff; stress-test its existing claims processing system; increase its capacity for prior authorizations; and educate the public and its help desk staff about the change in coverage for pharmacy services. Grants the Department rulemaking authority. Repeals a provision that permits the Department to enter into a contract with a third party on a fee-for-service reimbursement model for the purpose of administering pharmacy benefits for recipients not enrolled in a Medicaid managed care organization. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":4788,"committee":{"committee_id":4788,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Appropriations-Health & Human Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":4788,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Appropriations-Health & Human Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-12-19","action":"Prefiled with Clerk by Rep.
