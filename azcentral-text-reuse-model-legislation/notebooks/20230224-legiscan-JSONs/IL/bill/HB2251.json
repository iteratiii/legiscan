Provides that (i) a professional license shall be valid for a period of 240 days (rather than 120 days) unless sooner suspended or revoked, (ii) the Director of Public Health may renew a provisional license once for a period not to exceed 90 days (rather than 120 days) from the expiration date of the initial provisional license, and (iii) the fee for each single home health agency license or any renewal shall be $1,000 (rather than $25). Removes language requiring the Department of Public Health to develop and implement one application to be used even if a combination of licenses authorized under the Act is sought. Provides that the Home Health and Home Services Advisory Committee shall be composed of 15 voting members and one nonvoting member (rather than just 15 members). Provides that 2 (rather than one) of the voting members shall be individuals who represent an organization that advocates for consumers, and the nonvoting member shall be a home services worker. Provides that if the Department finds that a violation does not pose a substantial risk to the health or safety of an agency's clients or patients, the Department may choose to request a plan of correction for the Department's approval prior to issuing a notice of violation to the agency. Provides that if the agency fails to submit an acceptable plan of correction or fails to implement a Department-approved plan of correction within the time provided by the Department, the Department shall then issue the notice of violation.
