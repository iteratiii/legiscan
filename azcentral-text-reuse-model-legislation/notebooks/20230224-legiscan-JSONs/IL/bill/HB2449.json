Provides that the amendatory Act may be referred to as the Title Insurance Reform Act of 2023. Provides that no person, firm, partnership, association, corporation or other legal entity shall act as or hold itself out to be a title insurance agent without first procuring a certificate of authority from the Secretary of Financial and Professional Regulation (rather than unless duly registered by a title insurance company with the Secretary). Provides that a certificate of authority shall remain in effect unless revoked or suspended by the Secretary or voluntarily withdrawn by the holder, or when the holder of the certificate of authority is no longer authorized as a title insurance agent of a title insurance company. Provides that every applicant that is not duly registered as a title insurance agent on the effective date of the amendatory Act shall comply with specified requirements. Provides that the Secretary shall maintain a database of title insurance agents in good standing on a publicly accessible website that any person may use to verify the authority of a particular title insurance agent. Sets forth duties applicable to transactions involving residential real property for title insurance companies, title insurance agents, and independent escrowees.
