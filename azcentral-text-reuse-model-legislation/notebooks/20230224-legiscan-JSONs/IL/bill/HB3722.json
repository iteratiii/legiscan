Allows the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the Senate to appoint one member each to an advisory committee that determines which homes contain windows or doors that cause offensive odors and are eligible for replacement pursuant to the Residential Sound Insulation Program. Provides that residents who altered or modified a replacement window or accepted a replacement screen for the window as an interim solution or partial replacement that failed to mitigate, in whole or in part, an odorous or malfunctioning window shall not be disqualified from compensation or future services (rather than residents who altered or modified a replacement window or accepted a replacement screen for the window shall not be disqualified from compensation or future services). Provides that residents who have altered or modified a replacement window, or accepted a replacement screen for the window as an interim solution or partial replacement, who apply for future mitigation services shall be sequenced in the ordinary course of the Residential Sound Insulation Program upon a finding of eligibility. Provides at least 10% of the homes receiving a replacement in a year shall be homes that have demonstrated extreme hardship, except when at least 10% of the number of applicants eligible to receive a replacement fail to demonstrate extreme hardship. Provides that the advisory committee shall accept all public questions concerning the Residential Sound Insulation Program (rather than all public questions) and furnish a written response within 2 business days. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
