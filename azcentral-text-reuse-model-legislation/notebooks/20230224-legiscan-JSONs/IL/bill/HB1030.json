Provides that, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a hospital or a hospital's agent may not aggressively pursue debt collection for non-payment of a hospital bill against a patient with an annual household income of $51,000 or less by garnishing wages, seizing moneys from tax returns, or pursuing an action that may result in foreclosure on the patient's home. Provides that, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a hospital, whenever possible and after reviewing a patient's eligibility, shall charge as much as possible of the patient's hospital bill to insurers, public assistance programs, the medical assistance program established under the Illinois Public Aid Code, or the Medicare program rather than the patient. Provides that the hospital, and not the patient, is responsible for seeking reimbursement from insurers, public assistance programs, the medical assistance program established under the Illinois Public Aid Code, or the Medicare program.","pending_committee_id":3301,"committee":{"committee_id":3301,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Civil"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":3301,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Civil"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-12-19","action":"Prefiled with Clerk by Rep.
