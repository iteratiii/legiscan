Requires the Department of Human Services to track and collect data on the scope and frequency of SNAP benefits fraud in Illinois where a SNAP recipient's benefits are stolen from the recipient's electronic benefits transfer card by means of card skimming, card cloning, or some other similar fraudulent method. Requires the Department to specifically keep a record of every report made to the Department by a SNAP recipient alleging the theft of benefits due to no fault of the recipient, the benefit amount stolen, and, if practicable, how those stolen benefits were used and the location of those thefts. Requires the Department to report its findings to the General Assembly on a quarterly basis beginning in calendar year 2024. Provides that a SNAP recipient's personally identifiable information shall be excluded from the reports consistent with State and federal privacy protections; and that each quarterly report shall be posted on the Department's official website. Provides that if the Department determines that a SNAP recipient has made a substantiated report of stolen benefits due to card skimming, card cloning, or some other similar fraudulent method, the Department shall refer the matter to the Attorney General and shall provide any assistance to the Attorney General in the prosecution of the alleged theft or fraud.","pending_committee_id":212,"committee":{"committee_id":212,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Human Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":212,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Human Services"},{"date":"2023-02-24","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
