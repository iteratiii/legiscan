Modifies the definitions of \"supervisor\" and \"unit\". In the definition of \"supervisor\", specifies that the authority to assign is not an indication of supervisory status. In the definition of \"unit\", prohibits a unit from including (i) employees and managerial employees or (ii) managerial employees only. Provides that no public employee position shall be excluded from a bargaining unit prior to that position being filled. Provides, with respect to bargaining units in existence on the amendatory Act's effective date, that the Illinois Labor Relations Board shall, in describing the unit found appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining, describe the unit in terms of job functions rather than job titles. Provides that for those units descriptions may also include the currently existing job titles that perform the job functions. Provides that these existing bargaining units shall also include positions later filled that perform the job functions of a unit and job titles later created that: (i) are successor job titles to the currently existing job titles; (ii) perform the same or substantially similar job functions as the currently existing job titles; or (iii) are logically encompassed within an existing unit.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
