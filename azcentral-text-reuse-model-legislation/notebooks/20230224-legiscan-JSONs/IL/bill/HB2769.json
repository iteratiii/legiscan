In provisions concerning the Department of Human Services' Health Local Food Incentives Program, expands the program to provide grants to farm stands, mobile markets, community-supported agriculture sites, grocery stores, and other direct food retailers that participate in the SNAP program (rather than providing grants to participating Illinois farmers markets and direct producer-to-consumer venues). Requires the Department to consult and cooperate with non-profit organizations to develop and implement rules to distribute grants under the program (rather than designating a single non-profit organization or agency to receive an annual $500,000 grant to be distributed to participating Illinois farmers markets and direct producer-to-consumer venues).
