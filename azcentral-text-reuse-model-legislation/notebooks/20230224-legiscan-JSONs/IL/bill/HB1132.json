Defines \"laser installation operator\", \"laser safety officer\", \"temporary laser display\", and \"temporary laser display operator\". Throughout the Act, refers to laser installation operators or temporary laser display operators (rather than just operators). Requires laser installations to employ a laser safety officer. Requires the Illinois Emergency Management Agency to adopt rules specifying minimum training and experience requirements for laser safety officers. Provides that, if a laser safety officer encounters noncompliance with the Act or rules adopted under the Act in the course of performing his or her duties as a laser safety officer, then the laser safety officer shall report that noncompliance to the Agency as soon as practical. Requires temporary laser display operators to ensure that each temporary laser display has a laser safety officer physically present at the setup, rehearsal, and performance to ensure that all laser systems in operation at the laser installation meet the requirements of the Act and any rules adopted by the Agency under the Act. Requires temporary laser displays and laser safety officers to maintain a policy of general liability insurance in an amount that is commercially reasonable, but not less than $1,000,000, and that covers each temporary laser display and laser safety officer. Requires temporary laser display operators to register with the Agency prior to conducting a temporary laser display. Contains notification requirements. Makes other changes.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":2892,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Labor & Commerce"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
