Affirms these vital birth-to-3 services are a top priority for increased public resources, to strengthen their quality and extend their reach to more of the children, parents, and families who could benefit from them, particularly in communities of greatest need and those hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. Affirms home-visiting and Early Intervention services are an appropriate and necessary use for some of the hundreds of millions of funding coming to Illinois from the settlement of lawsuits against opioid makers and distributors, initiatives that can help meet the settlements' stated aims of boosting opioid remediation, treatment, and prevention.","pending_committee_id":282,"committee":{"committee_id":282,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Public Health"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":282,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Public Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Filed with Secretary","chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Referred to Assignments","chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Added as Chief Co-Sponsor Sen.
