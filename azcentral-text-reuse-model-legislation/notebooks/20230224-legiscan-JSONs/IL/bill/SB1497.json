Provides that \"emergency\" means a situation, physical condition, or one or more practices, methods, or operations that present imminent danger of death or serious physical or mental harm to residents of a facility and that are clinically documented in the resident's medical record (rather than only a situation, physical condition or one or more practices, methods or operations that present imminent danger of death or serious physical or mental harm to residents of a facility). Requires the need for positioning devices to be demonstrated and documented in the resident's care plan. Requires that assessment to be revisited in every comprehensive assessment of the resident. Provides that psychotropic medication shall be administered to a resident only if clinical documentation in the resident's medical record supports the benefit of the psychotropic medication over contraindications related to other prescribed medications and supports the diagnosis of the resident. Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a resident is in a state of emergency, the emergency shall be clinically documented in the resident's medical record.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
