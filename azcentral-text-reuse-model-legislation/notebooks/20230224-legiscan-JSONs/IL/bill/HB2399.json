Provides for the registration of third-party providers that ship wine to residents of this State on behalf of winery shippers. With regard to third-party providers, sets forth provisions concerning registration applications; recordkeeping; reporting; and suspending, revoking, or refusing to issue or renew a registration. Provides that a carrier may not deliver to a consumer a package known by the carrier to contain wine unless the consignor is a licensed winery shipper or registered third-party provider and the carrier has verified that license or registration for the current license period. Requires winery shippers, third-party providers, and carriers to file with the Illinois Liquor Control Commission a monthly report containing specified information concerning wine shipments. Provides that the State Commission may suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew a license to manufacture, distribute, or sell alcoholic liquor issued by the State Commission if the State Commission finds, after notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, that the person holding the license has shipped alcoholic liquor into another state in violation of that state's law. Makes other changes.
