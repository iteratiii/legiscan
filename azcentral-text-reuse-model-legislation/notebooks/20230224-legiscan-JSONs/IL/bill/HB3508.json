Provides that the amendatory Act may be referred to as the PFAS Pathways Act. Contains legislative findings. Requires the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) require select wastewater treatment plants' to report the results of analysis of raw influent sewage, treated sewage effluent, and sewage sludge residuals for PFAS; (2) produce and publish on the Agency's website a report on the eventual dispersion of PFAS through the treatment process; and (3) review the Agency's database of wastewater treatment plants, determine methods of processed sewage sludge disposal, and estimate the annual quantities of processed sewage sludge disposal on land, whether or not it is disposed of in-state or out-of-state. Requires the Prairie Research Institute's Illinois Sustainable Technology Center to: (1) review the list of contaminants of emerging concern in a specified report and determine what other chemical compounds have an environmental impact similar to PFAS; (2) determine appropriate methods for destroying PFAS; and (3) estimate the financial impact on wastewater treatment plants in this State from the methods for destroying PFAS. Allows the Agency to propose, and the Pollution Control Board to adopt, rules establishing maximum concentrations of PFAS that may be contained in an Exceptional Quality biosolid or sewage sludge that is to be applied to land. Makes a conforming change in the Environmental Protection Act.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
