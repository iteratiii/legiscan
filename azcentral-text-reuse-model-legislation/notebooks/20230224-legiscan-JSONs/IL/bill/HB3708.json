In the provisions concerning review by the State Treasurer, review team, and Governor, expands the categories allowing a municipality to become a financially distressed city. Includes provisions allowing the municipality's Financial Advisory Authority to commence an action in circuit court to enforce the Law if the corporate authorities or employees of the municipality materially violate the provisions of the Law.
