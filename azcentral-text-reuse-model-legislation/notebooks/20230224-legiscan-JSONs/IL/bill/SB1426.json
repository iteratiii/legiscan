Removes language providing that all potential authorized collection sites that offer to participate in a drug take-back program shall be counted towards meeting the minimum number of authorized collection sites within a drug take-back program. Removes language providing that, if the Environmental Protection Agency receives more than one proposal for a drug take-back program, the Agency shall review all proposals in conjunction with one another to ensure the proposals are coordinated to achieve the authorized collection site coverage. In provisions regarding drug take-back program promotion, provides that if there is more than one drug take-back program operated by more than one manufacturer program operator, the provisions shall be implemented individually by each drug take-back program, except that approved drug take-back programs shall coordinate to provide and maintain a single toll-free number and website publicizing collection options and collection sites (rather than implemented by all drug take-back programs collectively using a single toll-free number and website and similar education, outreach, and promotional materials). Makes other changes.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
