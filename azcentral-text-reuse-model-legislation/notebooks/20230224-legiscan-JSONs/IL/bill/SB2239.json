Provides that, if it is determined that significant disproportionality is occurring, the school shall provide that determination for annual review and, if appropriate, revision of the policies, practices, and procedures used in disciplinary removals to ensure that the policies, practices, and procedures comply with the district's equity requirements. Provides that notice of suspension shall also include other evidence-based alternatives to suspension. provides that when a student is suspended for more than 4 days, that options for automatically placing the student in an e-learning program or distance learning program through written materials if (1) the removal is for more than 5 consecutive school days; or (2) the child has been subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern, because the series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year, because the child's behavior is substantially similar to the child's behavior in previous incidents that resulted in the series of removals, and the effects of additional factors such as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the removals to one another shall be included.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
