In provisions concerning provider notification of dental plan changes, provides that no insurer, service corporation, dental service plan corporation, insurance network leasing company, or any company that issues, delivers, amends, or renews an individual or group policy of accident and health insurance on or after the effective date of the amendatory Act that provides dental insurance may automatically enroll a provider in a leased network without the provider's written consent. Provides that any contract entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of the amendatory Act that allows the rights and obligations of the contract to be assigned or leased to another insurer shall provide for notice that informs each provider in writing via certified mail 90 days before any scheduled assignment or lease of the network to which the provider is a contracted provider (rather than shall provide notice of that assignment or lease within 30 days after the assignment or lease to the contracting dentist). Provides that an insurer, service corporation, dental service plan corporation, insurance network leasing company, or any company that issues, delivers, amends, or renews an individual or group policy of accident and health insurance on or after the effective date of the amendatory Act that provides dental insurance that leases or assigns its network shall not cancel a network participating dentist's contractual relationship or otherwise penalize a network participating dentist in any way based on whether or not the dentist accepts the terms of the assignment or lease.","pending_committee_id":215,"committee":{"committee_id":215,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Insurance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":215,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Insurance"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
