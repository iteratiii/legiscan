Provides that each telecommunications carrier, wireless carrier, cable and video service provider, and Interconnected VoIP service provider shall notify its customers that if the customer wishes to participate in the funding of the Illinois Broadband Adoption Fund, the customer may do so by electing to contribute on a monthly basis a fixed amount that will be included in the customer's monthly bill. Provides that the fixed amount choices shall include, but not be limited to, $1, $2, or $5 per month. Provides that if the customer has elected electronic billing, the customer shall also be notified monthly of the opportunity to contribute to the fund.
