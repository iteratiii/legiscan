Provides that the Illinois Racing Board may appoint the Director of Mutuels to serve as the State director for inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering by inter-track wagering licensees and inter-track wagering location licensees. Provides that the pari-mutuel tax imposed at all pari-mutuel wagering facilities and on advance deposit wagering shall be remitted to the Board (rather than the Department of Revenue). Provides that the Board shall distribute contributed funds to a charitable organization on a schedule determined by the Board, based on the charitable organization's estimated expenditures related to the grant (rather than by December 31 of each year).
