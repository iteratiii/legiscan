Makes changes concerning the admissibility of hospital or public or private agency records in an adjudicatory hearing concerning an abused, neglected, or dependent minor. Requires the court to find that the document was made in the regular course of the business of the hospital or agency (instead of that the document was made in the regular course of the business of the hospital or agency and that it was in the regular course of such business to make it). Provides that a certification by an agent (in addition to the head or s responsible employee) of the hospital or agency attesting that a record satisfies specified conditions shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in such certification. Deletes language requiring that a certification by someone other than the head of the hospital or agency shall be accompanied by a photocopy of a delegation of authority signed by both the head of the hospital or agency and by such other employee.","pending_committee_id":3301,"committee":{"committee_id":3301,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Civil"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":3301,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Civil"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
