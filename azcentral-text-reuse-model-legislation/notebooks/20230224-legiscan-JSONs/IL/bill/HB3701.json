Provides that it is unlawful for any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, or other legal entity to act as or hold itself out to be a title insurance agent without first procuring a license from the Secretary of Financial and Professional Regulation. Provides that the Secretary or the Secretary's authorized representative shall have the power and authority to compel an independent escrowee's compliance with the provisions of the Act. Provides that every title insurance agent shall pay specified fees. Provides that the Secretary may require participation in a third-party, multi-state licensing system. Sets forth additional title insurance licensing requirements for applicants. Provides that a title insurance license shall be renewed every 2 years (rather than annually). Sets forth provisions concerning premiums and endorsement charges. Provides that the Secretary may refuse to grant, and may suspend or revoke, any certificate of authority, registration, or license or may impose a fine if he or she determines that the holder of or applicant for such certificate, registration, or license has engaged in specified acts. Removes language that provides that expenses incurred in the course of such examinations will be the responsibility of the title insurance company, and that if a present or former registered agent or its successor refuses or is unable to cooperate with a title insurance company in furnishing the records requested by the Secretary or his or her authorized agent, then the Secretary or his or her authorized agent shall have the power and authority to obtain those records directly from the registered agent.
