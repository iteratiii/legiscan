To the extent allowed under federal law, caps the civil penalties that can be levied against a municipality for NPDES-related violations of the Act at $50,000. Provides that, if the Agency brings an enforcement action under the Act against a municipality for an NPDES-related violation, then it is the affirmative obligation of the Environmental Protection Agency (i) to provide the municipality with all technical assistance requested by the municipality and necessary to resolve the environmental condition that is responsible for the violation and (ii) to make available to the municipality financial assistance that the Agency is authorized under State or federal law to supply to the municipality to resolve that condition. Requires the Agency, before seeking civil penalties against a municipality under the Act or before taking any other legal action against a municipality under this Act, to hold a public hearing within the municipality to explain the rationale for the enforcement action. Requires public notice of the meeting to be published by the Agency in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected municipality.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
