Requires the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt rules that require: (1) the owner or operator of each landfill in the State to establish and implement a plan to identify and address PFAS-contaminated leachate that is generated at the landfill before it migrates off site or is sent off site for treatment or disposal and (2) the owner or operator of each wastewater treatment facility in the State to establish and implement a plan to treat PFAS-contaminated wastewater prior to its discharge from the facility. Provides that owners or operators of landfills or wastewater treatment plants who violate the rules are subject to the same penalties as provided for manufacturers under other provisions of the Act. Authorizes these penalties to be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the People of the State of Illinois by the State's Attorney of the county in which the violation occurred or by the Attorney General. Specifies that any penalties collected in an action in which the Attorney General has prevailed shall be deposited in the Environmental Protection Trust Fund, to be used in accordance with the provisions of the Environmental Protection Trust Fund Act.","pending_committee_id":3250,"committee":{"committee_id":3250,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Environment and Conservation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":3250,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Environment and Conservation"},{"date":"2023-02-24","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
