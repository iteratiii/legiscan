Provides that an applicant or licensee under the Act is not in violation of the Act or its rules and shall not be subject to disciplinary action for operating a game device if operation of the game device is in compliance with and not considered gambling under the Criminal Code of 2012. Amends the Sports Wagering Act. In provisions concerning the lottery sports wagering pilot program, provides that all lottery games, including sports wagering games and programs, are a part of the Department of the Lottery's private management agreement and competitive bidding process under the Illinois Lottery Law (rather than the Department issuing a central system provider license pursuant to an open and competitive bidding process). Requires the Department to implement and administer the program no later than June 30, 2024 and that sports lottery terminals be available for play within 90 days after the effective date of the amendatory Act. Makes changes in provisions concerning the placement of sports lottery terminals, wagers accepted, distribution of proceeds, and the Department's powers. Provides that the Department shall be responsible for facilitating the purchase or lease of all sports lottery terminals. Changes the repeal date of the pilot program to January 1, 2032 (rather than January 1, 2024). Makes other changes. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-14","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
