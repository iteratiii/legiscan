Provides that the court shall not order any assessments, such as fees, fines, or administrative costs, except for assessments made in traffic, boating, or fish and game law, or municipal ordinance violations as provided in the Act, against a minor subject to the Minors Requiring Authoritative Intervention Article, Addicted Minors Article, or Delinquent Minors Article of the Act or against the minor's parent, guardian, or legal custodian. Provides that, except for assessments made in traffic, boating, or fish and game law, or municipal ordinance violations as provided in the Act, any judgment, order, agreement, or other legally enforceable encumbrance directing a minor or his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian to pay assessments prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act is null, void, and not collectible if there remains a balance due, including interest, penalties, or collection fees. Provides that, if the court orders community service for the minor, community service shall not interfere with the school hours, school-related activities, or work commitments of the minor or the minor's parent, guardian, or legal custodian. Provides that the court shall not order a minor or the minor's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to pay costs relating to any sentencing order, including any fee, fine, or administrative cost authorized under certain provisions of the Unified Code of Corrections. Provides that the inability of a minor, or minor's parent, guardian, or legal custodian, to cover the costs associated with an appropriate sentencing order shall not be the basis for the court to enter a sentencing order incongruent with the court's findings regarding the offense on which the minor was adjudicated or the mitigating factors. Provides that, one year after the effective date of the amendatory Act, the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts shall report to the General Assembly: (1) the number of judgments, orders, agreements, or other legally enforceable encumbrances vacated pursuant to this provision in each judicial district; and (2) the total balances of fees, fines, and administrative costs vacated in each judicial district. Makes other changes. Amends other Acts to make conforming changes.
