In provisions requiring non-exempt local governments to approve an affordable housing plan, provides that, in addition to other requirements, the affordable housing plan must consist of a description of any housing market conditions, infrastructure limitations, local government ordinances, local policies or practices that do not affirmatively further fair housing as defined in the federal Fair Housing Act, and other local factors that constrain the local government's ability to create and preserve affordable housing. Requires the plan to also include potential strategies to eliminate or mitigate the specified constraints. Provides that the plan must set forth certain benchmark goals for new affordable housing developments or redevelopments; as well as proposed timelines, within the first 24 months after the date upon which the affordable housing plan was adopted, for actions to implement the components of the affordable housing plan. Provides that no later than 36 months after adopting or updating an affordable housing plan, the local government shall submit a report to the Illinois Housing Development Authority summarizing actions taken to implement the current plan.
