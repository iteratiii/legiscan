Allows a board of education to enter into a contract, of no longer than 3 months in duration, with a third party for non-instructional services currently performed by an employee or bargaining unit member in an emergency situation that threatens the safety or health of the school district's students or staff or in the event of a disaster as defined in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (instead of for the purpose of augmenting the current workforce in an emergency situation that threatens the safety or health of the school district's students). Provides that if, at the end of the contract, the Governor or the Director of Public Health has declared a disaster and all or part of the territory of the school district is covered by such a declaration, then the school board may renew the contract for a term of no longer than 3 months. Provides that changes made by Public Act 95-241 do not apply to a school board if the school district's most recent final percent of adequacy under the evidence-based funding formula provisions is less than 85%. Allows a school board whose most recent final percent of adequacy is less than 85% to enter into a third-party contract for non-instructional services currently performed by an employee or bargaining unit member or lay off an educational support personnel employee, provided that the affected employee receives written notice of the removal or dismissal at least 30 days before the employee is removed or dismissed.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
