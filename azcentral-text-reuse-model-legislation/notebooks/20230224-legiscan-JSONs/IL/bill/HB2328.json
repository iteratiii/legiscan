Provides that the Illinois Juvenile Justice Commission shall study and make recommendations to the General Assembly regarding the availability of youth services to reduce the use of detention and prevent deeper criminal involvement. Amends the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. Provides that placement of a minor away from his or her home must be a last resort and the least restrictive alternative available. Provides that any minor 14 (rather than 10) years of age or older may be kept or detained in an authorized detention facility if the minor is arrested pursuant to the Act and there is probable cause to believe that the minor is a delinquent minor and that secure custody is a matter of immediate and urgent necessity in light of specified factors. Provides that no minor under 14 (instead of 12) years of age shall be detained in a county jail or a municipal lockup for more than 6 hours. Provides that a minor found to be guilty may be committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice if the minor is at least 14 (rather than 13) years and under 20 years of age, if the minor was found guilty of a felony offense or first degree murder. Provides that a minor under the age of 14 who is in violation of the law may be the subject of a petition under the Minors Requiring Authoritative Intervention Article of the Act, or may be held accountable through a community mediation program.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-14","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
