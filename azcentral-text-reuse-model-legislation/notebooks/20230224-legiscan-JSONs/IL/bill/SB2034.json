Provides that the Act may be referred to as Zachary's Parent Protection Act. Provides that an employee of a large employer that employs 250 or more full-time employees is entitled to use a maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid leave if the employee experiences the loss of a child by suicide or homicide. Provides that an employee of a small employer that employs at least 50 but fewer than 250 full-time employees is entitled to use a maximum of 6 weeks of unpaid leave if the employee experiences the loss of a child by suicide or homicide. Provides that leave may be taken in a single continuous period or intermittently in increments of no less than 4 hours, but leave must be completed within one year after the employee notifies the employer of the loss. Permits an employer to require reasonable advance notice of the employee's intention to leave and reasonable documentation. Provides that an employee who takes leave under the Act is entitled to be restored to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or to be restored to an equivalent position. Provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed to entitle any restored employee the accrual of any seniority or employment benefits during any period of leave. Provides that the Act does not extend the maximum period of leave to which an employee is entitled under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or under any other paid or unpaid leave provided under federal, State or local law, a collective bargaining agreement, or an employment benefits program or plan. Prohibits an employer from taking any adverse action against an employee who exercises his or her rights under the Act. Requires the Department of Labor to enforce the Act. Provides that a person who uses leave under either the Child Bereavement Leave Act or the Child Extended Bereavement Leave Act may not take leave under the other Act, and amends the Child Bereavement Leave Act accordingly.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-09","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
