Provides that if a respondent to an order of protection is subject to remedies prohibiting firearm possession, the order of protection shall also include an order to surrender firearms. Sets forth requirements for the surrendering of any firearm and law enforcement agencies providing statements of receipt of firearms. Provides that the failure to surrender any firearm within 24 hours to the appropriate law enforcement agency under an order to surrender firearms shall constitute contempt of court for the violation of the terms of the order of protection. Requires the Supreme Court to adopt a form for an order to surrender firearms and update any existing forms for an order of protection. Makes corresponding changes in the Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.","pending_committee_id":3302,"committee":{"committee_id":3302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Criminal"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":3302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Judiciary - Criminal"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
