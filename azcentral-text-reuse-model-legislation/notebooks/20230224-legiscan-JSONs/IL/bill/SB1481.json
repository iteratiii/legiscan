Allows the State Board of Elections to receive voter registration information provided by applicants using electronic voter registration portals (rather than the Board's website). Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who is otherwise qualified to vote may preregister to vote on or after that person's 16th birthday, with the registration held in abeyance by the appropriate election authority until that individual attains the required age to vote. Requires preregistration to be completed using the online voter registration system or an electronic voter registration portal. Provides that, for the purposes of the Code, an individual who is 16 years of age or older (rather than who is 17 years of age and who will be 18 years of age on the date of the general or consolidated election) shall be deemed competent to execute and attest to any voter registration forms.","pending_committee_id":264,"committee":{"committee_id":264,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Elections"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":267,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Executive"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":264,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Elections"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
