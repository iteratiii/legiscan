Provides that a trafficking victim may petition for vacation and expungement of an offense (rather than shall be eligible to petition for immediate sealing) upon the completion of his or her last sentence if his or her participation in the underlying offense was proximately caused by the human trafficking (rather than a direct result of human trafficking). Provides that, if the offense is a crime of violence, the trafficking victim may petition for immediate sealing of the offense upon the completion of his or her last sentence. Provides that a petition may be prepared, signed, and filed electronically. Provides that the court may allow the petitioner to attend any required hearing remotely by audiovisual conference if the petition affirms that attendance in court would be an undue hardship or could create a risk of harm to the petitioner, and provides that the court may allow a petition to be filed under seal if the public filing of the petition would constitute a risk of harm to the petitioner.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-14","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
