Provides that the Department of Children and Family Services, in conjunction with the Department of Human Services, shall develop a comprehensive list of children and youth under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with intellectual and developmental disabilities or with a mental illness and are referred to a children's group home, an Illinois public school, a therapeutic day school, or a private in-state or out-of-state residential program or hospital due to their need for behavioral health services and supports. Requires the Department of Children and Family Services (Department) to work in conjunction with other specified State agencies to (i) track the referrals, monitor any possible overlap between agencies, track funding streams, track the number of available facilities, staff, and beds, and establish clear processes and memoranda of understanding for the exchange of this information; and (ii) establish a Short-Term Stabilization Home Model to serve eligible children and youth who have behavioral challenges that have not been stabilized despite interventions to support such children and youth in their communities. Provides that the Department and other specified entities shall be responsible for making referrals to the short-term stabilization homes. Provides that the Department shall work in conjunction with individual service coordination agencies in the child or youth's geographic area to identify potential short-term stabilization home participants. Requires the Department to establish a Transition to Adulthood Model as an intensive transition program that serves young adults from the age of 18 to the day before their 26th birthday. Provides that the Transition to Adulthood Model shall include educational services so that young adults receiving services under the model can learn how to navigate within their own community, use public transportation, plan and purchase meals, self-advocate, plan social activities, and attend institutions of higher learning, among other social activities.
