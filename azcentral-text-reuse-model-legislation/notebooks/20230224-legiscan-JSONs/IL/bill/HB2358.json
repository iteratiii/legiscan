Changes the Rental Housing Support Program State surcharge a county recorder must collect on each real-estate related document from $9 to $18. Increases the fee a county may charge for recording documents. Makes conforming changes. Amends the Rental Housing Support Program Act. Provides that, as part of the Illinois Housing Development Authority's request-for-proposals process for soliciting proposals from local administering agencies and for awarding grants, best efforts will be used to prioritize local administering agencies that serve the county in which annual receipts were collected upon receipt of current data from the Department of Revenue applicable to the annual receipts. Provides that the Authority shall use best efforts through outreach to local administering agencies to encourage at least one local administering agency to serve each county (rather than working with each county to ensure that at least one local administering agency is located within each county). Creates the Illinois Rental Housing Support Program Funding Allocation Task Force, which shall study and make recommendations regarding the equitable distribution of rental housing support funds across the State and shall also work with the Authority as funding allocations will be required to be adjusted due to data released by the United States Census Bureau on the 2020 decennial census.
