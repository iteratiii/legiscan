For specified applications, change of address forms, or recertifications of a driver's license or State identification card, provides that the application, form, or recertification shall serve as a dual-purpose application when the applicant presents specified identification (rather than meets the requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005). Modifies requirements of the dual-purpose application. Modifies the content of the written notice required to be given by the Office of the Secretary of State to each applicant and requires the Office of the Secretary of State to determine whether each applicant is currently registered to vote in Illinois and the applicant's registration address. Provides that, if an applicant provides the Secretary of State with an identification document which demonstrates that the applicant is not a United States citizen, the application shall not serve as a dual-purpose application. Makes conforming and other changes. Provides that changes made by the amendatory Act that require implementation shall be implemented no later than January 1, 2025. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
