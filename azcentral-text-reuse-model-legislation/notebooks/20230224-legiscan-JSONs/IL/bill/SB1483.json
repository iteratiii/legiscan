Provides that a person convicted of a felony or otherwise under sentence in a correctional institution shall have his or her right to vote restored and shall be eligible to vote not later than 14 days following his or her conviction or not later than 5 days before the first election following the person's confinement (rather than prohibiting a person who has been convicted of any crime and is serving a sentence of confinement from voting until his or her release from confinement). Requires the election authority to collaborate with a correctional institution to facilitate an opportunity for voting by mail for eligible electors to vote in that election jurisdiction who are incarcerated in the correctional institution. Provides that all requirements of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other federal, State, and local laws regarding language access and disability access apply to the provisions. Requires the correctional institution to make available to persons in custody resource materials relating to an election. Requires the State Board of Elections in coordination with correctional institutions to annually report certain data regarding compliance with the provisions. Makes conforming changes throughout the Code and in the Unified Code of Corrections.
