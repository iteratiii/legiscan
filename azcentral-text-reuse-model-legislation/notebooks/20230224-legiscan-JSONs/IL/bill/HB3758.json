Provides that the Board of Higher Education shall, in consultation with the Illinois Community College Board, create a standardized electronic form through which a community college district may document student demand or workforce needs for a specific baccalaureate degree completion program and may demonstrate that the demand or needs are currently unmet or that there is insufficient access to such a program for students in the district. Provides that the form must be completed by the requesting community college district and must be submitted to the Illinois Community College Board for initial review. Provides that if the Illinois Community College Board concurs with the community college district that unmet demand or needs exist in the district, the Illinois Community College Board must forward the form to the Board and if the Illinois Community College Board does not concur with the community college district, the district may appeal the decision directly to the Board.
