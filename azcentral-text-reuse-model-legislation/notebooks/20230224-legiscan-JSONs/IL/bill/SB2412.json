In the definition of \"child welfare services\", provides that one of the purposes of the Department of Children and Family Services is to place children in suitable permanent family arrangements (rather than in suitable adoptive homes), in cases where restoration to the biological family is not safe, possible, or appropriate. Removes language providing that one of the purposes of the Department's child welfare services is to assure safe and adequate care of children away from their homes, in cases where the child cannot be returned home or cannot be placed for adoption. Repeals a provision requiring the Department of Children and Family Services to establish the Governor's Youth Services Initiative.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
