Provides that the Illinois Labor Relations Board shall determine whether refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with a labor organization that is the exclusive representative of public employees in an appropriate unit, including, but not limited to, the discussing of grievances with the exclusive representative, was of a serious enough nature that it may undermined or significantly impact the collective bargaining process such that other traditional remedies may not remedy the violation if the Board is unable to order a make-whole remedy. Sets forth standards to make the determination and the option to order impasse arbitration. Provides that parties continue to have a duty to engage in good faith bargaining during the pendency of impasse arbitration procedures. Provides that the Board shall have authority to order make-whole relief, including, but not limited to, consequential damages and front pay for injuries suffered by employees or a labor organization as a result of an unfair labor practice. Provides that violators may also be subject to liquidated damages in an amount equal to any monetary make-whole relief ordered by the Board unless the employer can show it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe it was acting in compliance.","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
