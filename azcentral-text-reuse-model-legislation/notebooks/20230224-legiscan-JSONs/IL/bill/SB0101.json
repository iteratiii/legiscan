Provides that no group or individual policy of accident and health insurance or managed care plan shall deny or delay coverage for medically necessary treatment because the insured, enrollee, or beneficiary previously received any treatment, including the same or similar treatment, for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections or pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, or because the insured, enrollee, or beneficiary has been diagnosed with or receives treatment for an otherwise diagnosed condition. Provides that coverage of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections and pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric syndrome shall adhere to the treatment recommendations developed by a medical professional consortium convened for the purposes of researching, identifying, and publishing best practice standards for diagnosis and treatment of such disorders or syndrome that are accessible for medical professionals and are based on evidence of positive patient outcomes. Provides that coverage for any form of medically necessary treatment shall not be limited over a lifetime of an insured, enrollee, or beneficiary, unless the patient is no longer benefiting from the treatment, or by policy period. Provides that nothing in the provisions prevents insurers from requesting treatment notes and anticipated duration of treatment and outcomes.
