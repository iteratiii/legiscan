Makes various changes to the definitions. Provides that owners or operators of underground utility facilities are required to be members of the One-Call Notice system (rather than the State-Wide One-Call Notice System). Provides that if, upon notice from the One-Call Notice system, an underground utility facility owner or operator determines there is a critical underground utility facility within the proposed excavation area and the underground utility facility owner or operator desires to have an authorized representative present during excavation near the critical underground utility facility, the underground utility facility owner or operator shall contact the excavator prior to the dig start date and time provided on the notice to schedule a date and time for the underground utility facility owner or operator to be present when excavation will occur near the critical underground utility facility. Provides for the following: a positive response system; a planning design notification; and a joint meet notification. Requires geographic information system data to be provided to the One-Call Notice system. Makes changes in provisions concerning: required activities; emergency excavation or demolition; damage or dislocation; liability or financial responsibility; negligence; record of notice and marking of facilities; penalties, liability, and fund; emergency telephone system outages and reimbursement; noncompliance and enforcement action time frames; mandamus or injunction; and home rule. Provides that if any previously unmarked underground utility facility is exposed during excavation or demolition, emergency or nonemergency, the excavator responsible for excavation or demolition operations shall immediately notify the One-Call Notice System. Repeals the definition of \"person\" and a provision concerning notice of preconstruction conference. Makes technical and other changes.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
