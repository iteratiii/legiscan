Provides that a driver of a motor vehicle that is controlled or operated by or for a farmer is not required to obtain a commercial drivers license or commercial learners permit when such motor vehicle is being used to transport: agricultural products; implements of husbandry; or farm supplies; to and from a farm, as long as such movement is not over 150 air miles from the originating farm if traveling interstate. Removes language that requires drivers of any truck-tractor semitrailer combination or combinations operating as a covered farm vehicle to successfully complete tests the Secretary of State deems necessary. Provides that when operating any truck-tractor semitrailer combination as a covered farm vehicle, the exemption applies only to persons age 21 or older, if operating the vehicle in interstate driving, and to persons at least 16 (rather than 18) years of age, if operating the vehicle in intrastate driving.","pending_committee_id":316,"committee":{"committee_id":316,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":316,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
