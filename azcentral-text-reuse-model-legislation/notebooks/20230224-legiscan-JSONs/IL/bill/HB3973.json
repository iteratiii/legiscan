In the Abused, Neglected, or Dependent Minors Article of the Act, provides that an environment is injurious if conditions in the child's environment create a real, significant and imminent likelihood of moderate to severe harm to the child's health, well-being, or welfare and the parent or caretaker blatantly disregarded his or her parental responsibility to prevent or mitigate such harm. Provides that in making a custody determination, the court shall presume that it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of the minor to remain in the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian who experienced domestic violence, unless the court has determined that the parent, guardian, or custodian who experienced domestic violence has committed acts or omissions unrelated to domestic violence against that parent, guardian, or custodian that is sufficient to independently support a determination of abuse or neglect under the Act.
