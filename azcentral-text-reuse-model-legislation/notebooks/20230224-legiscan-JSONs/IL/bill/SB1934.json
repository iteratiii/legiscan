Provides that the Environmental Protection Agency may require an RA for a site to make an advance partial payment of $2,500 (rather than an advance partial payment not exceeding $5,000 or one-half the total anticipated costs of the Agency, whichever sum is less). Makes changes concerning the persons who must review and approve site remediation plans. Allows reviews undertaken by the Agency or a RELPEG to be completed and the decisions communicated to the RA within 90 days after the request for review or approval if 2 or more plans or reports are submitted concurrently. Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision, the Agency is not required to take action on any submission from or on behalf of an RA if the RA has failed to pay all fees due. Requires any deadline for Agency action on such a submission to be tolled until the fees are paid in full. Makes other changes.","pending_committee_id":3250,"committee":{"committee_id":3250,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Environment and Conservation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-09","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":3250,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Environment and Conservation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
