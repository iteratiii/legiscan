Removes language providing that: the Governor shall appoint a special temporary panel of commissioners comprised of 3 members; the members shall hold office until the Human Rights Commission determines that the caseload of requests for review has been reduced sufficiently to allow cases to proceed in a timely manner, or for a term of 18 months from the date of appointment by the Governor, whichever is earlier; each of the 3 members shall have only such rights and powers of a commissioner necessary to dispose of the cases assigned to the special panel; each of the 3 members appointed to the special panel shall receive the same salary as other commissioners for the duration of the panel; and the panel shall have the authority to hire and supervise a staff attorney who shall report to the panel of commissioners. Requires the Commission to appoint at the expense of the Commission a qualified interpreter (rather than a qualified sign language interpreter) whenever a hearing impaired individual or an individual who lacks proficiency in the English language is a party or witness in proceedings before the Commission (rather than at a public hearing).","pending_committee_id":4483,"committee":{"committee_id":4483,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Immigration & Human Rights"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-16","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":4483,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Immigration & Human Rights"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
