Provides that a prisoner who is serving a sentence for first degree murder, other than serving a term of natural life imprisonment, shall receive no more than 4.5 days of sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of imprisonment (rather than serve the entire sentence imposed by the court). Changes certain sentence credits for a prisoner from no more than 4.5 to no more than 7.5 days of sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of imprisonment. Provides that the Director of Corrections or the Director of Juvenile Justice may award earned sentence credits if the credits do not reduce the sentence by a specified amount (rather than award up to 180 days of earned sentence credit for prisoners serving a sentence or incarcerating of less than 5 years, and up to 365 days of earned sentence credit for prisoners serving a sentence of 5 years or longer). Provides that the Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile Justice shall award sentence credit accumulated prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act in an amount specified to an inmate serving a sentence for an offense committed on or after June 19, 1998, if the Department determines that the inmate is entitled to this sentence credit based upon specified documentation.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
