Requires hospitals to screen patients for health insurance and financial assistance. Prohibits the sale of a patient's medical debt by a hospital. Prohibits hospitals from offering a payment plan to an uninsured patient without first exhausting any discount available to the uninsured patient under the Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act and from entering into a payment plan for a bill that is eligible to be discounted by 100% under the Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act. Makes other changes. Amends the Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act. Provides that hospital may not make the availability of a discount and maximum collectible amount contingent upon an uninsured patient's eligibility for specified programs if the patient declines to apply for a public health insurance program on the basis of concern for immigration-related consequences to the patient, which shall not be grounds for the hospital to deny financial assistance under the hospital's financial assistance policy.","pending_committee_id":275,"committee":{"committee_id":275,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Insurance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-09","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":275,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Insurance"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
