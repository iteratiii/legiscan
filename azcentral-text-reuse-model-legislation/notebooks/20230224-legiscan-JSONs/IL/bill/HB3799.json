In the definition of \"blatant disregard\", provides that \"blatant disregard\" is not present when an incident involving a failure to provide food, shelter, or clothing that otherwise would be characterized as \"blatant disregard\" is solely attributable to the financial inability of the child's parent or the other person responsible for the child's welfare. In the definition of \"neglected child\", adds that \"neglected child\" means any child who is not receiving care necessary for his or her well-being, including adequate food, clothing, and shelter, even when the parent or person responsible for the child is financially able to do so or has been offered financial or other means to do so. Provides that a child shall not be considered neglected for the sole reason that the parent or other person responsible for the child in need of supportive services is unable to provide the care necessary for his or her well-being based exclusively on the parent's, or other responsible person's, financial inability. Defines \"child in need of supportive services\". Sets forth certain requirements the Department of Children and Family Services must complete before considering a child to be a neglected child, including evaluating the family's financial circumstances and offering appropriate family preservation services or referring the family for a child welfare services referral.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
