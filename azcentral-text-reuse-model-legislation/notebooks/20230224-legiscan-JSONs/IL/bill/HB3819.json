Provides that a deflection program may accept, receive, and disburse, in furtherance of its duties and functions, any funds, grants, and services made available by the State and its agencies, the federal government and its agencies, units of local government, and private or civic sources. Provides that activities eligible for funding under the Act include naloxone and related harm reduction supplies (rather than related supplies) necessary for carrying out overdose prevention and reversal (rather than overdose reversal) for purposes of distribution to program participants or for use by law enforcement, other first responders, or local governmental agencies and wraparound participant funds to be used to incentivize participation and meet participant needs.
