Establishes procedures for determining whether a child is fit to stand trial. Provides that the procedures apply to a child under the age of 21, regardless of whether the person is subject to the Act or prosecuted under the criminal laws of the State. Provides that unfitness may result from the presence of any condition or confluence of conditions, including, but not limited to, mental illness, substance use disorder, developmental disability, chronological immaturity, relative immaturity, or child traumatic stress. Provides that a diagnosis is not required for a finding of unfitness. Provides that a child is unfit when the child either: (1) lacks sufficient present ability to consult with the child's attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, as evidenced by lacking the ability to disclose to the attorney facts pertinent to the proceedings at issue and to assist in the child's defense; or (2) lacks a rational or a factual understanding of the proceedings against the child, as evidenced by certain specified factors. Provides that the issue of the child's fitness to stand trial, to plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the child's attorney, the State, or the court at any time before a plea is entered or before, during, or after trial. Provides that in making determinations on the issue of a child's fitness, the following burdens of proof and presumptions shall apply: (1) when the court finds a bona fide doubt as to the fitness of a child, the State bears the burden of proving that the child is fit by clear and convincing evidence; and (2) a child who is receiving medication shall not be presumed to be fit or unfit to stand trial solely by virtue of the receipt of that medication. Provides that the Illinois Juvenile Justice Commission shall develop and recommend mechanisms to collect and analyze data, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, geography, age, and socioeconomic status, resulting from the implementation of these provisions. Provides that the report and recommendations shall be submitted to the General Assembly on or before January 1, 2024. Contains a severability provision.
