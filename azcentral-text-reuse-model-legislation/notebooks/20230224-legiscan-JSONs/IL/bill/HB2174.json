Requires any energy policy statement to explicitly include the minimum standards. Provides that a written energy policy statement may not condition approval of an application on approval by adjacent property owners. Restricts an association from inquiring into a property owner's energy usage, imposing conditions impairing the operation of a solar energy system, imposing conditions negatively impacting any component warranty, or requiring post-installation reporting. Provides that a property owner may not be denied permission to install a solar energy system based on system ownership or financing method chosen by the property owner. Allows an association's written energy policy statement to impose reasonable conditions concerning the location of on-site storage of materials and equipment during the installation process and the maintenance, repair, replacement, and ultimate removal of damaged or inoperable systems. Provides that no energy policy statement shall be valid unless recorded as required by applicable law in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county where the property is located. Requires an application for approval to be made available in hard copy form at a property owner's request or, if the association maintains a website, through the website. Provides that an application shall be processed by the appropriate approving entity of the association within 30 (rather than 75) days of the submission of the application. Provides that if an association fails to adopt a written solar energy policy statement or process an application for approval within the specified time, the property owner may proceed with the installation or use of the proposed solar energy system notwithstanding any other policy or provision in the homeowners' common interest community or condominium unit owners' association declaration. Allows a property owner to resubmit an application for approval previously denied by an association, and requires any such resubmitted application shall be evaluated under the changes made by the amendatory Act. Makes conforming and other changes. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":3958,"committee":{"committee_id":3958,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Energy & Environment"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-15","committee_id":3958,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Energy & Environment"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
