Provides that the Illinois Labor Relations Board shall determine whether refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with a labor organization that is the exclusive representative of public employees in an appropriate unit, including, but not limited to, the discussing of grievances with the exclusive representative, was of a serious enough nature that it undermined or significantly impacted the collective bargaining process such that other traditional remedies may not remedy the violation if the Board is unable to order a make-whole remedy. Sets forth standards to make the determination and the option to order impasse arbitration. Provides that parties continue to have a duty to engage in good faith bargaining during the pendency of impasse arbitration procedures. Provides that the Board shall have authority to order make-whole relief, including, but not limited to, consequential damages and front pay for injuries suffered by employees or a labor organization as a result of an unfair labor practice. Provides that violators may also be subject to liquidated damages in an amount equal to any monetary make-whole relief ordered by the Board unless the employer can show it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe it was acting in compliance in this Act.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
