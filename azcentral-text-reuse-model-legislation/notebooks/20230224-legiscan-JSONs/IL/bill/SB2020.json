Makes various changes concerning sales in error. In provisions allowing a sale in error if the assessor, chief county assessment officer, board of review, board of appeals, or other county official has made an error, provides that the error must be material to the tax sale at issue and may not be an error in the description of the physical characteristics, location, or picture of the property. Removes provisions allowing a sale in error when a bankruptcy petition has been filed after the tax sale and before the issuance of the tax deed. Provides that, if the bankruptcy petition is filed prior to the tax sale, then a sale in error is allowed if the property is subject to an automatic stay and the stay is active on the date of the date of that sale. Provides that the $100 fee paid by a tax purchaser for a certificate of purchase is non-refundable.
