Provides that no later than 60 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall initiate a docketed rulemaking reviewing each gas public utility tariff that provides for gas main and gas service extensions without additional charge to new customers in excess of the default extensions without charge as specified in administrative rule.
