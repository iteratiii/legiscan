Provides that the analysis of the impact of any demand side and renewable energy initiatives including the proposed mix and selection of standard wholesale products for which contracts will be executed during the next year to meet that portion of its load requirements not met through preexisting contracts shall not preclude consideration of long-term contracts of up to and including 20 years for clean energy with an appropriate portion of the portfolio to be allocated to such long-term contracts. Provides the analysis shall further include for products procured for delivery years beginning after May 31, 2025, consideration of whether products offered into the procurement process are clean energy and give a preference to clean energy where such product or products can be procured at or below the price of nonclean energy after taking account of the social cost of carbon as set forth in provisions concerning the zero emission standard. Provides that for all eligible retail customers served by an alternative retail electric supplier, or electric utility other than the electric utility in whose service area a customer is located, such supplier or utility shall purchase products that include the same percentage of clean energy as was procured for the utility in whose service area such customers are located for the immediately prior delivery year. Makes a corresponding change to the Illinois Power Agency Act.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
