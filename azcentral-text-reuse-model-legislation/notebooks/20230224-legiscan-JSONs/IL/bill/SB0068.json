Provides that, with regard to any policy, contract, or plan offered, entered into, issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2024 by a health insurer, life insurer, or long-term care insurer authorized to transact insurance in this State, a health insurer, life insurer, or long-term care insurer may not: (1) cancel, limit, or deny coverage or establish differentials in premium rates based on a person's genetic information; or (2) require or solicit an individual's genetic information, use an individual's genetic test results, or consider an individual's decisions or actions relating to genetic information or a genetic test in any manner for any insurance purpose. Provides that the provisions may not be construed as preventing a life insurer or long-term care insurer from accessing an individual's medical record as part of an application exam. Provides that nothing in the provisions prohibits a life insurer or long-term care insurer from considering a medical diagnosis included in an individual's medical record, even if the diagnosis is based on the results of a genetic test.
