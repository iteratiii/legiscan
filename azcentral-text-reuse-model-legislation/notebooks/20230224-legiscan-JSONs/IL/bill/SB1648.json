For Tier 2 participants: provides that an employee whose disability continues after the employee has received ordinary disability benefits for the maximum period of time and who withdraws before becoming eligible for a retirement annuity while still so disabled is entitled to receive an annuity in such amount as can be provided from the total sum accumulated to the employee's credit from employee and employer contributions, to be computed as of the employee's age on the date of withdrawal; provides that the annuity shall not be subject to any automatic annual increases and that the minimum annuity shall not apply; provides that the annuity to which the employee's spouse shall be entitled upon the employee's death shall be fixed on the date of the employee's withdrawal and shall be provided on a reversionary annuity basis; and provides that the annuity shall not be subject to any automatic annual increases and that the minimum widow's annuity shall not apply.
