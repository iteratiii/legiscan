Provides that if the respondent to an order of protection is required to surrender any firearms, the order of protection shall also include an order to surrender firearms. Requires the respondent to surrender any firearms under an order to surrender on the day the respondent is served with the order of protection. Removes the requirement that a prohibition on the possession of firearms be issued only after a hearing of which the respondent received actual notice, and at which the person had an opportunity to participate. Requires the law enforcement agency receiving any surrendered firearms to provide a statement of receipt of any firearm to the respondent and the court. Provides that the failure to surrender any firearm within 24 hours to the individual or law enforcement agency under an order to surrender firearms shall constitute contempt of court for the violation of the terms of the order of protection. Requires the Supreme Court to adopt a form for an order to surrender firearms and update any existing forms for an order of protection to reflect the changes made by the amendatory Act. Provides that if any Firearm Owner's Identification Card of the respondent is surrendered, the period of surrender shall be for the duration of the order of protection. Makes corresponding changes in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":4057,"committee":{"committee_id":4057,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Firearms"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-06","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":267,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Executive"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":4057,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Firearms"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
