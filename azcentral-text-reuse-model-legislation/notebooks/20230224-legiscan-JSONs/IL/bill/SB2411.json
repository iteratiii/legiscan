Requires the Department to establish a multi-disciplinary advisory committee to advise the Department and its related contractors in the development and implementation of the safety-based child welfare intervention system. Requires the Department to develop safety-based child welfare intervention system training curriculum. Requires the Department to submit annual reports, beginning on or before December 31, 2026, to the General Assembly on the evaluation of the reliability and validity of the safety-based child welfare intervention system.
