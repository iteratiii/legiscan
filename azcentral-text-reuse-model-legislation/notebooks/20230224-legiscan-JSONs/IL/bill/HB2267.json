Changes the definition of \"public health supervision\". Provides that without the supervision of a dentist, a dental hygienist may perform dental health education functions, including instruction in proper oral health care and dental hygiene in, for example, a school setting, a long-term care facility, and a health fair (rather than just either a school setting and a long-term care facility). Provides that a dental hygienist may record case (rather than care) histories and oral conditions. Provides that a dentist may enter into an agreement for public health supervision with 4 (rather than 2) public health dental hygienists. Provides that the Department of Public Health Oral Health Section shall compile and publicize public health dental hygienist service data annually. Makes other changes.","pending_committee_id":209,"committee":{"committee_id":209,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Health Care Licenses"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":209,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Health Care Licenses"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
