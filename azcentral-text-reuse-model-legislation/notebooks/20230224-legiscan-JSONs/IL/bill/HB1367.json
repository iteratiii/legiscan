Provides that a \"temporary container\" is, among other things, a single container of sufficient size to hold cremated remains only until an urn is acquired. Provides that a funeral director (rather than a crematory authority or authorizing agent) has responsibilities specified throughout the Act. Provides that a crematory authority shall not cremate human remains until it has received, among other things, the name of the funeral establishment or cemetery (rather than the person) authorized to receive the cremated remains from the crematory authority and the manner in which final disposition of the cremated remains is to take place, whether it be burial, entombment, or inurnment in a cemetery. Provides that cremated remains must (rather than may) be disposed of by placing them in a grave, crypt, or niche in a designated cemetery. Removes language authorizing a crematory authority to dispose of cremated remains in a specified manner if the authorizing agent has not, within 60 days following the date of the cremation, instructed the crematory authority to arrange for the final disposition of the remains or claimed the remains. Removes language allowing for the disposal of cremated remains commingled with those of another person when scattering cremated remains at sea, by air, or in an area located in a dedicated cemetery and used exclusively for those purposes. Provides that an authorizing agent has the right to request and retain up to 8 ounces of cremated remains for memorialization before final disposition of the remains and requires funeral directors to notify an authorizing agent of that right. Makes other changes.","pending_committee_id":239,"committee":{"committee_id":239,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"State Government Administration"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":239,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"State Government Administration"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
