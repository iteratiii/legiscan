Provides that the Amusement Ride and Attraction Safety Board may hire such clerical and administrative help as it deems necessary, to be paid out of an appropriation from the Amusement Ride and Patron Safety Fund (rather than from an appropriation to the Board). Removes a provision providing that the Director of the Department of Labor may promulgate rules to establish a schedule of fees for inspections. Provides that the Director, after consultation with and the consent of the Board, shall determine a schedule of inspection fees and permit fees (rather than just permit fees) for each amusement ride or amusement attraction. Provides that the Director may accept applications for a permit not filed at least 30 days prior to the first day of operation or the expiration of the permit only if the applicant applies for the permit prior to the inspection of the ride or attraction. Provides that if, upon inspection, the Department determines that an element or elements of an amusement ride or amusement attraction is in violation of the Act or any rules adopted under it, the Department may issue a correction notice to the owner or operator, allowing the owner or operator to continue operating the amusement ride or amusement attraction, but requiring the owner or operator to address the deficiency and come into compliance with adopted standards by a set deadline. Provides that, if the owner or operator does not meet the deadline established in the correction notice, the Department may issue a Cessation Order as described in subsection (b) of this Section. Makes changes in provisions concerning: insurance; penalties; contracting with an entity; injunctions to compel compliance; the Amusement Ride and Patron Safety Fund; exemptions; waivers of inspections; and employment of carnival and amusement enterprise workers. Makes other changes.","pending_committee_id":191,"committee":{"committee_id":191,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Consumer Protection"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":191,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Consumer Protection"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
