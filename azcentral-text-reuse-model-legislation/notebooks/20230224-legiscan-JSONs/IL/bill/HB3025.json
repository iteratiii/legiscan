Restructures the provisions concerning the conditions of parole and mandatory supervised release. Provides that any and all conditions of parole or mandatory supervised release shall be imposed by the Prisoner Review Board, unless the conditions of release are being imposed or modified by a parole agent. Provides that any condition imposed by the Prisoner Review Board shall not be more restrictive than necessary to: (1) comply with the parolee or releasee's gender responsive risks, assets, and needs assessment; (2) achieve public safety; and (3) facilitate successful reintegration back into the community. Provides that parole agents shall not modify an existing condition of release or add additional conditions of release without approval from the Prisoner Review Board unless doing so under a rule adopted by the Department of Corrections. Provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law, a parolee or releasee must comply with specific instructions of a parole agent related to complying with conditions already set and approved by the Prisoner Review Board or otherwise imposed by law, exclusive of placement on electronic monitoring or home detention. Provides that all subjects found to be at a low risk to recidivate shall be subject to low-level or no supervision, except for specified offenses. Provides that parole or mandatory supervised release shall not be revoked solely for failure to comply with a condition of release that requires the parolee or releasee to affirmatively do something, unless there is sufficient evidence the failure was willful. Provides that when considering whether the failure was willful, the parole agent and the Prisoner Review Board must consider the person's ability to pay and the availability of programs or other resources necessary to compliance. Provides that conditions of parole or mandatory supervised release may (rather than shall) include referral to an alcohol or drug abuse treatment program, as appropriate, only when necessary to comply with trauma and gender informed risk, assets, and needs assessment.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-16","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
