Provides that the clerk of the circuit court shall notify the jury administrator or jury commissioners of each jury summons that is returned indicating a change of address. Provides that, not less often than every 3 months, the jury administrator or jury commissioners shall send the local election authority a list of each such change of address. Amends the Election Code. Contains provisions concerning the cancellation of voter registration if the county clerk is of the opinion that the person is not a qualified voter or has ceased to be a qualified voter. In provisions requiring election authorities to automatically register a voter who has moved to a new jurisdiction in Illinois or within the jurisdiction, requires the election authority to act within 90 days of receipt of information from the National Change of Address Linkage System. Requires county clerks and the Board of Election Commissioners to complete verifications of voter registrations after a consolidated election in an odd-numbered year but before the first day allowed for circulation of a petition for nomination for a candidate for the following primary election in an even-numbered year (rather than at least once in every 2 years). Requires the county clerks and the Board of Election Commissioners to certify to the State Board of Elections that the verification has been conducted and completed within 30 days of completion of the verification.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
