Provides that the judge shall enter an order permitting prosecution under the criminal laws of Illinois unless the judge makes a finding based on clear and convincing evidence that the minor would be amenable to the care, treatment, and training programs available through the facilities of the juvenile court based on an evaluation of: (1) any involvement of the minor in the child welfare system, (2) whether there is evidence the minor was subjected to outside pressure, including peer pressure, familial pressure, or negative influences, and (3) the minor's degree of participation and specific role in the offense. Amends the Unified Code of Corrections.
