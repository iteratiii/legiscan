Requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to provide individuals who are noncitizens or are legally admitted permanent residents the same medical assistance coverage for family planning and family planning-related services and supplies that is provided to eligible persons who are United States citizens, if they meet all other eligibility qualifications under the family planning benefits program established in accordance with the State's Family Planning State Plan Amendment as approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Requires the Department to ensure parity of male contraceptive services provided under the family planning benefits program with a carve-out from the prospective payment system rate that allows encounter rate clinics, federally qualified health centers, and rural health centers to bill under the fee-for-service payment methodology based on the most current practitioner fee schedule for the vasectomy procedure (55250) with patient consultation services and any post-operative visits covered at the usual prospective payment system rate. Requires the Department to adopt reproductive justice-aligned measures of contraceptive access and quality as part of the Department's core set of health care quality measures for medical assistance and to annually report and post on its website the success of such measures beginning in calendar year 2024. Provides that if national measures of contraceptive access and quality are adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department may consider aligning State quality measures for contraceptive access and quality with such national recommendations. Provides that the Department, in conjunction with a statewide association representing Medicaid managed care health plans that are contracted with the Department and the organizers of a statewide contraceptive access initiative, shall develop a process to collect the patient centered contraceptive counseling measure endorsed by the National Quality Forum and shall annually report and post on its website the outcomes. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
