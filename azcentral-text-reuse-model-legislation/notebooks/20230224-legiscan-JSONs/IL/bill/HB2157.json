Requires a public institution of higher education to adopt a policy that makes certain documentation submitted by an enrolled or admitted student sufficient to establish that the student is an individual with a disability. Requires the policy to be transparent and explicit regarding information about the process by which the public institution of higher education determines eligibility for accommodations for an individual with a disability. Provides that each public institution of higher education shall disseminate such information to students, parents, and faculty in accessible formats and make the information readily available on a public website of the institution. Allows a public institution of higher education to establish less burdensome criteria to establish whether an enrolled or admitted student is an individual with a disability. Requires a public institution of higher education to engage in an interactive process to establish a reasonable accommodation for an individual pursuant to the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.","pending_committee_id":210,"committee":{"committee_id":210,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Higher Education"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":210,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Higher Education"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
