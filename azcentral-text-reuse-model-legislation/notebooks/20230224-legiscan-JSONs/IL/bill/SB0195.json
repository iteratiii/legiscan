Provides that no petition for the appointment of a guardian of a minor shall be filed if the primary purpose of the filing is to reduce the financial resources available to the minor in order to cause the minor to qualify for public or private financial assistance from an educational institution. Allows the court to deny such a petition if it finds that the primary purpose of the filing is to enable the minor to declare financial independence so that the minor may obtain public or private financial assistance from an educational institution or a State or federal student financial aid program.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":277,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
