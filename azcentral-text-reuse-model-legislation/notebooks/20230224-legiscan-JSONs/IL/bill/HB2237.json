Makes changes to the definition of investment partnership to provide that a dealer in qualifying investment securities may be considered an investment partnership. Allows a partnership interest to be considered a qualified security if the interest qualifies as a security within the meaning of the federal Securities Act of 1933. In provisions requiring that no less than 90% of the investment partnership's gross income shall consist of interest, dividends, and gains from the sale or exchange of qualifying investment securities, provides that that includes the distributive share of partnership income from lower-tier partnership interests and does not include income from partnerships that are operating at a federal taxable loss.
