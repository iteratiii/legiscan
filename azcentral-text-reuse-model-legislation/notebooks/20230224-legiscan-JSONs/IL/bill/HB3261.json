Requires the Department of Children and Family Services to implement a differential response program. Provides that under the program, upon receiving a report of suspected child abuse or neglect the Department shall determine whether to conduct a family assessment or an investigation as appropriate to prevent or provide a remedy for child abuse or neglect. Provides that any report that does not involve an allegation of physical or sexual abuse shall be eligible for referral to the differential response program, specifically child maltreatment reports that only allege inadequate supervision of a child or conditions that create an injurious environment to a child. Provides that no family shall be deemed ineligible for participation in the differential response program based upon a prior report of abuse or neglect involving any member of the family. Provides that under the program, the Department shall only conduct a formal child abuse or neglect investigation on reports involving substantial child abuse or neglect. Provides that the Department shall document the outcome of a family assessment, but shall not report the case to the central register. Requires the Department to offer families who participate in a family assessment in-home services provided under the Intact Family Services program and Norman Emergency Cash Assistance and Housing Locator Services, if applicable. Provides that a family has the option of declining the services offered; and that if the family declines the services, the case shall be closed unless the Department determines that sufficient cause exists to begin an investigation. Amends the Department of Human Services Act. Requires the Department of Human Services to establish and administer a direct cash assistance program for youth 18 years of age and older but younger than 24 who are experiencing or are at risk of experiencing homelessness.
