Provides that a policeman who assumes regular employment for compensation, while in receipt of disability benefits (instead of ordinary or duty disability benefits), shall not be entitled to receive any amount of such disability benefits which, when added to his or her compensation for such employment during disability, would exceed 125% (instead of 150%) of the rate of salary which would be paid to the policeman if he or she were working in his or her regularly appointed civil service position as a policeman. Provides that each policeman who is granted a disability benefit shall supply the Fund with a copy of his or her federal and state tax returns, along with all accompanying schedules, within 30 days after filing those returns. Provides that a policeman shall have no further right to receive the disability benefit if the policeman refuses to provide his or her filed tax returns. Provides that a policeman shall have an affirmative obligation to inform the fund when he or she has received a medical opinion that he or she no longer has a disability. Provides that when the disability ceases, the policeman shall have no further right to receive the benefit and he or she shall be returned to active service. Makes other changes.
