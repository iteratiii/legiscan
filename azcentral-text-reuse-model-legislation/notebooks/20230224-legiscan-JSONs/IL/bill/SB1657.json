In provisions concerning the child care assistance program, requires the Department of Human Services to establish a semimonthly payment schedule for child care providers that have a purchase of service contract with the Department or a subcontractor of the Department. Provides that under the payment schedule, a child care provider shall receive payment on the 1st and 16th of each month for any child care services provided to a family approved for child care assistance. Provides that if payment is not made by the scheduled payment date, a child care provider may submit a written request for payment in a form and manner prescribed by the Department for the amount owed plus the amount of any financial losses or costs the child care provider incurred due to the nonpayment. Provides that a child care provider must submit the request-for-payment form to the Department within 3 months after the date of the nonpayment. Provides that any request-for-payment form submitted after the 3-month period shall not be processed for payment. Requires the Department to oversee the implementation of the semimonthly payment schedule and to receive and process all request-for-payment forms submitted by child care providers. Provides that nothing in the amendatory Act shall be construed to apply to monthly co-payments owed by a family under the child care assistance program.","pending_committee_id":4771,"committee":{"committee_id":4771,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Health and Human Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-14","committee_id":4771,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Health and Human Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
