Provides that any policy of automobile insurance that carries comprehensive coverage may not exclude theft coverage for lack of evidence of forcible entry or for the insured leaving the vehicle unlocked or leaving a key or key fob in the motor vehicle. Provides that no company authorized to transact insurance business in the State and no officer, director, agent, clerk, employee, or broker of such company shall upon proper application refuse to provide insurance on the basis of the specific geographic location of the risk sought to be insured (rather than solely on the basis of the specific geographic location). Provides that making or permitting any unfair discrimination between individuals or risks of the same class or of essentially the same hazard and expense element because of the geographic location of the insurance risks or applicants is an unfair method of competition and unfair and deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance. Effective 60 days after becoming law.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-16","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
