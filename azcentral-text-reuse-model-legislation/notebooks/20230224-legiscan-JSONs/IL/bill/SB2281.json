Allows dispensing organizations to establish a protocol to dispense cannabis on any real property or parking area under the dispensary's ownership or control, such as transactions at drive-through windows. Requires the protocol to adhere to the requirements for point-of-sale dispensing transactions under the Acts. In the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, removes language prohibiting dispensing organizations from operating drive-through windows. Prohibits dispensing organizations from transporting cannabis to residences or other locations beyond the real property or parking area under the ownership or control of the dispensary where purchasers may be for delivery (rather than from transporting cannabis to residences or other locations where purchasers may be for delivery).","pending_committee_id":254,"committee":{"committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
