Changes the term \"non-compliant identification card\" to \"standard identification card\". Changes the definition of \"limited term REAL ID compliant identification card\" to include cards that have been issued to an individual who has an approved application for asylum in the United States or has entered the United States in refugee status. Allows the Secretary of State to accept, as proof of date of birth and written signature of an applicant for a standard identification card, any passport from the applicant's country of citizenship or a consular identification document validly issued to an applicant. Prohibits the Secretary from releasing highly restricted personal information or personally identifying information or disclose documents to any immigration agent unless it is necessary to comply with a lawful court order, judicial warrant, or subpoena for individual records that specifically requires production of such information or documents. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into or maintaining any agreement regarding the sharing of such information or documents. Provides that no temporary visitor's driver's licenses shall be issued after the effective date of the amendatory Act. Provides that every driver's license application shall state the social security number of the applicant; except if the applicant is applying for a standard driver's license and is ineligible for a social security number, then if the applicant has documentation authorizing the applicant's presence in the country, the applicant shall provide such documentation instead of a social security number. Provides that if applicant does not have documentation authorizing the applicant's presence in the country, the applicant must submit documentation establishing that the applicant has resided in the State for a period in excess of one year and a passport validly issued to the applicant from the applicant's country of citizenship. Makes conforming changes in those Acts and the Consular Identification Document Act and the Election Code.
