Provides that a municipality may not approve redevelopment project areas or expansions of redevelopment project areas that overlap with an existing redevelopment project area. Provides that 10% of moneys deposited into the special tax allocation fund shall be transferred to the local chamber of commerce or chambers of commerce representing the redevelopment project area for the chamber or chambers of commerce to use for grants to businesses that employee fewer than 50 full-time employees if the business moves within the redevelopment project area. Provides that moneys transferred to a chamber of commerce not used or pledged within one year of transfer of the moneys shall be returned to the municipality and are designated surplus funds of the redevelopment project area. Adds nonvoting members to joint review boards.
