Provides that an electric utility subject to the requirements of the Illinois Solar for All Program may file a tariff with the Illinois Commerce Commission that creates a new rate for the supply of electric power and energy to low-income customers. Provides that the tariff shall allow for the developer of a community solar project that is the subject of a contract to sell its renewable energy credits executed pursuant to the Illinois Solar for All Program or the contract and payment terms of the renewable portfolio standard of the Illinois Power Agency Act to also enroll the project under the tariff. Provides for low-income customers the tariff shall automatically apply. Provides that the capacity and energy from the enrolled projects shall be used to serve the customers taking service under the rate authorized by these provisions. Provides that if an electric utility elects to file the tariff outside of a rate design filing, the Commission shall enter its order approving the tariff no later than 120 days after the date of the utility's filing. Provides that electric utilities that have a tariff, community solar projects enrolled in the program, and the customers taking service thereunder, shall be exempt from all application, contract, and disclosure requirements that may otherwise apply under the Illinois Power Agency Act.
