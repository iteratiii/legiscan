Provides that the Illinois Power Agency may qualify renewable energy credits associated with the electricity generated by a utility-scale wind energy facility or utility-scale photovoltaic facility and transmitted by a high voltage direct current transmission line (instead of a qualifying direct current project) to a delivery point on the electric transmission grid located in the State or a state adjacent to Illinois, if certain conditions are met. Amends the Public Utilities Act. Removes language that allows a qualifying direct current applicant that does not own, control, operate, or manage, within the State, any plant, equipment, or property used or to be used for the transmission of electricity at the time of its application or of the Illinois Commerce Commission's order to file an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity on or before December 31, 2023. Removes language that allows the Commission to grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct, operate, and maintain a qualifying direct current project. Effective immediately.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
