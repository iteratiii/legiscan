Authorizes the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to institute a year-round program (rather than program) to ensure the availability and affordability of heating and electric service to low income utility customers. Requires the Department to take all actions necessary to ensure year-round access to energy assistance by no later than July 1, 2024. Provides that, in setting the annual eligibility level for assistance under the Act, the Department shall not set a limit higher than 200% (rather than 150%) of the federal nonfarm poverty level as established by the federal Office of Management and Budget or 60% of the State median income for the current State fiscal year as established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Provides that the Department shall ensure that persons applying for energy assistance shall have the ability to establish eligibility through proof of enrollment in other State and federal assistance programs. Makes changes to provisions concerning the monthly Energy Assistance Charge assessed on customer accounts by public utilities, electric cooperatives, and municipal utilities. Provides that, beginning January 1, 2024 and for the next 10 years thereafter, electric and gas utilities shall annually contribute to the Supplemental Low-Income Energy Assistance Fund 5% net operating income based on their most recent rate order approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission. Makes changes concerning the Percentage of Income Payment Plan and other matters. Provides that an energy provider that receives payments from the Department from the Supplemental Low-Income Energy Assistance Fund, that provides confirmation to an administering agency that an applicant is a customer, shall ensure that the applicant customer is not disconnected from energy service while an application is pending.","pending_committee_id":4500,"committee":{"committee_id":4500,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-09","committee_id":254,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Assignments"},{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":4500,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":36,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Filed with Secretary by Sen.
