Includes legislative findings. Amends the Emergency Telephone System Act. Provides that the Illinois State Police, with the advice and recommendation of the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, shall adopt rules to allow a veteran to submit his or her name and phone number to the Administrator so that each time that veteran would call 9-1-1 or 9-8-8 that the 9-1-1 or 9-8-8 operator would see that the individual is a veteran and transmit that information to first responders, crisis responders, and deflection teams. Amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 and the Code of Civil Procedure. Provides that evidence related to a person's veteran status is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding, except in specified circumstances. Further amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 to provide that a person's veteran status shall not be used by the court to enhance the person's sentence. Amends the Unified Code of Corrections and the County Jail Act. Provides that a facility or county jail may not classify an inmate or prisoner as more dangerous or otherwise treat the inmate or prisoner less favorably than other inmates or prisoners due to the fact that the inmate or prisoner is a veteran or a combat veteran. Provides that each facility or county jail shall make available to all veterans within the facility or jail resources available to those inmates because of their veteran status, including benefits provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs, and other, non-VA benefits.","pending_committee_id":235,"committee":{"committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-17","committee_id":235,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":35,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
