a bioaccumulative chemical concern assigned before September 8, 2004, include information identifying the mixing zone in its application for a modification or approval of a KPDES permit; require that any change or extinguishment in a mixing zone requirement for a bioaccumulative chemical of concern only be accomplished through a formal KPDES permitting action by the Energy and Environment Cabinet conducted pursuant to administrative regulations promulgated under KRS Chapter 13A; amend KRS 224.16-090 to provide that if a KPDES permit applicant requests in their application for a modification or renewal of a permit that the Energy and Environment Cabinet take into account rapid and complete mixing at a wastewater outfall, the Energy and Environment Cabinet shall apply rapid and complete mixing in establishing water quality-based effluent limitations and conditions under the KPDES permit if the discharge occurs through a submerged high-rate multi-port outfall structure.","pending_committee_id":336,"committee":{"committee_id":336,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"name":"Committee on
