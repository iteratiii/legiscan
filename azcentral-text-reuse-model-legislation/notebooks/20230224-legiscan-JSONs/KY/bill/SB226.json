require the Energy and Environment Cabinet to clearly document its compliance with the requirements of the section in the fact sheet for the permit; provide that failure to clearly and adequately document compliance with the requirements of the section shall result in a stay in permit conditions for permits based on a narrative water quality standard for an outstanding state resource water upon the filing of a petition for an administrative hearing; amend KRS 224.10-225 to allow an applicant for a surface coal mining and reclamation operation to request for one stop shopping for environmental permits; provide that failure of the Energy and Environment Cabinet to adhere to the timelines for Clean Water Act permitting issuances shall constitute the making of a final determination, which shall allow the applicant to initiate an action in the Circuit Court for the county where the surface coal mining and reclamation operation is located or initiate an administrative hearing; define surface coal mining operations; amend KRS 224.16-050 to require the Energy and Environment Cabinet, when making a Clean Water Act Section 401 certification, to notify an applicant within 30 days of receiving an application if the application is incomplete; provide that if the application is incomplete, allow the applicant an additional 30 days to complete the application; provide that after receiving a complete application, the Energy and Environment Cabinet shall make a certification determination within 60 days; provide that if the certification determination is not made within 60 days, then the certification requirements are waived unless a time extension is otherwise agreed upon; provide that Clean Water Act Section 401 certifications shall be limited to water quality impacts from the discharge only; strike the requirement that the Governor must make a finding that the permitted activity would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth before the Energy and Environment Cabinet could engage in permitting and certification for the activity; prohibit the Energy and Environment Cabinet from delaying the issuance of a Clean Water Act permit based on the need or receipt of any other federal, state, or local permit or certification.","pending_committee_id":347,"committee":{"committee_id":347,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"name":"Natural Resources and Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-21","committee_id":336,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"name":"Committee on Committees"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":347,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"name":"Natural Resources and Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"introduced in Senate","chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"to Committee on Committees (S)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"to Natural Resources & Energy (S)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":44,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":22906,"person_hash":"ld20wred","party_id":"2","state_id":17,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Johnnie Turner","first_name":"Johnnie","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Turner","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-029","ftm_eid":6500017,"votesmart_id":18843,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":194845,"ballotpedia":"Johnnie_Turner_(Kentucky)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":318743,"subject_name":"Environment and Conservation"},{"subject_id":318772,"subject_name":"Federal Laws and Regulations"},{"subject_id":318648,"subject_name":"Minerals and Mining"},{"subject_id":318583,"subject_name":"State Agencies"},{"subject_id":318651,"subject_name":"Surface Mining"},{"subject_id":318694,"subject_name":"Waterways and Dams"},{"subject_id":318573,"subject_name":"Administrative Regulations and Proceedings"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2711965,"date":"0000-00-00","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/KY\/text\/SB226\/id\/2711965","state_link":"https:\/\/apps.legislature.ky.gov\/recorddocuments\/bill\/23RS\/sb226\/orig_bill.pdf","text_size":89778,"text_hash":"626f3505c277117bf949a3428db8b6fd"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
