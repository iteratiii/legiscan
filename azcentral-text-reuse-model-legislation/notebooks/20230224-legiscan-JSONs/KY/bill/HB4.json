until the transferee completes the documentation required by the Act and the secretary of the Energy and Environment cabinet accepts it as complete; provide that application approval conditions that

transfer requirements of the Act; allow for the decommissioning of the facility if it is still noncompliant after 90 days of suspension of its operation; create a new section of Subchapter 10 of KRS Chapter 224 to require that if a merchant electric facility fails to complete its decommissioning plan within 18 months of ceasing to produce electricity for sale, then the cabinet shall draw upon the decommissioning bond and implement the decommissioning plan; require the Energy and Environment Cabinet within 90 days of the effective date of the Act to promulgate administrative regulations to
