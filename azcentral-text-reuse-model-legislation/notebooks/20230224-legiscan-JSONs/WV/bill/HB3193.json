The bill establishes requirements for an order for payment of medical monitoring expenses. The bill provides that an increased risk of disease is not a compensable basis for damages in any civil action. The bill provides that, where awarded, payment of medical monitoring expenses shall not be paid to a prevailing plaintiff until the procedure is completed. The bill requires that, where awarded, defendants pay medical monitoring expenses into a fund established by the court for that purpose. Finally, the bill provides for the return of any money remaining in the fund after medical monitoring is no longer required to the defendants.","pending_committee_id":11,"committee":{"committee_id":11,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"name":"Judiciary"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":11,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Filed for introduction","chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"To Judiciary","chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Introduced in House","chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"To House Judiciary","chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":22834,"person_hash":"uvgdfihw","party_id":"2","state_id":48,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Phil Mallow","first_name":"Phil","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mallow","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-050","ftm_eid":21776882,"votesmart_id":148613,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":476392,"ballotpedia":"Phil_Mallow","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":24279,"person_hash":"u1auj7ir","party_id":"2","state_id":48,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Devault","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Devault","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-074","ftm_eid":54859442,"votesmart_id":201734,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":24275,"person_hash":"hd9dli50","party_id":"2","state_id":48,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Adkins","first_name":"David","middle_name":"Flimsy","last_name":"Adkins","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-030","ftm_eid":54859363,"votesmart_id":201720,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"David_Adkins_(West_Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":24287,"person_hash":"jzlrg428","party_id":"2","state_id":48,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Keith Marple","first_name":"Keith","middle_name":"","last_name":"Marple","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-069","ftm_eid":54859433,"votesmart_id":201745,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"Keith_Marple","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22816,"person_hash":"exbx9ty7","party_id":"2","state_id":48,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Forsht","first_name":"Donald","middle_name":"Herbert","last_name":"Forsht","suffix":"","nickname":"Don","district":"HD-060","ftm_eid":48823226,"votesmart_id":190635,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":731035,"ballotpedia":"Don_Forsht","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22869,"person_hash":"c67sc5h2","party_id":"2","state_id":48,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"George Miller","first_name":"George","middle_name":"Allen","last_name":"Miller","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-058","ftm_eid":48823224,"votesmart_id":190634,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":731032,"ballotpedia":"George_Miller_(West_Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":6,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":129213,"subject_name":"Actions, Suits and Liens"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2671310,"date":"0000-00-00","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/WV\/text\/HB3193\/id\/2671310","state_link":"http:\/\/www.wvlegislature.gov\/Bill_Status\/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb3193%20intr.htm&yr=2023&sesstype=RS&i=3193","text_size":6147,"text_hash":"3ab9225e01f60f22d84445ca9dc1b46b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-24","time":"09:00","location":"House Committee on the Judiciary room 410-M","description":"House Committee on the Judiciary Meeting"}]}}
