This would facilitate more cooperation between economic development authorities in the areas of the state where geographic constraints may prevent a multiple-county undertaking, though municipalities are able to contribute resources to the project.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":4693,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":1,"name":"Economic
