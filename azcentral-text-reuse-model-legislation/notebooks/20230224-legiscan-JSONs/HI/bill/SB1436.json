Establishes a definition of \"program\" and \"project\" to preempt the existing definitions under section 11-200.1-2, Hawaii Administrative Rules, and narrow the existing interpretation that requires analysis of tangentially related projects. Amends the applicability and requirements section of HEPA to clarify when multiple actions must be considered in the same environmental review document for the purposes of project segmentation. Expands the requirement that project opponents must exhaust their administrative remedies as a prerequisite to litigation to apply to environmental assessments and environmental impact statements. Retroactively applies to projects that received approval for their environmental assessment or environmental impact statement on or after August 9, 2019.","pending_committee_id":3578,"committee":{"committee_id":3578,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"name":"Agriculture and Environment"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-30","committee_id":3578,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"name":"Agriculture and Environment"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Introduced.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Passed First Reading.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Referred to AEN\/HOU, JDC.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8385,"person_hash":"wncze68c","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gil Keith-agaran","first_name":"Gil","middle_name":"S Coloma","last_name":"Keith-agaran","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-005","ftm_eid":6511845,"votesmart_id":110947,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":274051,"ballotpedia":"Gilbert_Keith-Agaran","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB1247","sast_bill_id":1678970}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":365597,"subject_name":"Hawaii Environmental Policy Act"},{"subject_id":178005,"subject_name":"Environmental Impact Statements"},{"subject_id":178004,"subject_name":"Environmental Assessments"},{"subject_id":177484,"subject_name":"Affordable Housing"},{"subject_id":365598,"subject_name":"Project Segmentation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2661659,"date":"2023-01-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/HI\/text\/SB1436\/id\/2661659","state_link":"https:\/\/www.capitol.hawaii.gov\/sessions\/session2023\/bills\/SB1436_.HTM","text_size":52374,"text_hash":"1904741ca32beed03a28e0d549b50991"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
