Requires employers who deny the compensability of an employee's injury to submit a written report supporting the denial to the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations within a specified period. Requires employers to furnish to the injured employee up to $10,000 for medical care, services, and supplies for the period immediately following the injury and so long as reasonably needed or until the employer files a written report with the Director denying the compensability of the injury, whichever is earlier. Clarifies that failure to give an employer notice of an employee's injury does not bar a claim for compensation if any person having authority in the interest of the employer had knowledge of the injury.","pending_committee_id":4757,"committee":{"committee_id":4757,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"name":"Labor & Government Operations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-25","committee_id":4757,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"name":"Labor & Government Operations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Pending introduction.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-20","action":"Introduced and Pass First Reading.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Referred to LGO, CPC, FIN, referral sheet 1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":24512,"person_hash":"wqyaxfca","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Darius Kila","first_name":"Darius","middle_name":"K.","last_name":"Kila","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-044","ftm_eid":55691568,"votesmart_id":208501,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":814241,"ballotpedia":"Darius_Kila","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB918","sast_bill_id":1674515}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":177233,"subject_name":"Workers' Compensation"},{"subject_id":363985,"subject_name":"Disability Benefits"},{"subject_id":363986,"subject_name":"Death Benefits"},{"subject_id":363987,"subject_name":"Notice by Employer"},{"subject_id":363988,"subject_name":"Medical Benefits"},{"subject_id":363989,"subject_name":"Knowledge of Injury"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2652969,"date":"2023-01-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/HI\/text\/HB283\/id\/2652969","state_link":"https:\/\/www.capitol.hawaii.gov\/sessions\/session2023\/bills\/HB283_.HTM","text_size":103607,"text_hash":"03db38ee4076cdfdf7e78fc608e2209f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
