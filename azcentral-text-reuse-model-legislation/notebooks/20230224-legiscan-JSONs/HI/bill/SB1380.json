Removes the requirement that a certifying physician or advanced practice registered nurse have a \"bona fide\" physician-patient or advanced practice registered nurse-patient relationship to certify that a patient has a debilitating medical condition pursuant to chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes. Defines \"waiting room\" within a medical cannabis retail dispensary and allows primary caregivers, qualifying out-of-state patients, and caregivers of a qualifying out-of-state patient to access the waiting room; clarifies that each day of a violation of chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is a separate violation; and amends the rule-making authority for dispensary-to-dispensary sales. Requires medical cannabis dispensaries, in conjunction with physicians and advanced practice registered nurses who issue written certifications pursuant to section 329-123, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to conduct the continuing education and training program required by section 329D-26, Hawaii Revised Statutes, rather than the Department of Health.
