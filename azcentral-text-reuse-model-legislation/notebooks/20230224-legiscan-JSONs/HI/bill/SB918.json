Requires employers who deny the compensability of an employee's injury to submit a written report supporting the denial to the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations within a specified period. Requires employers to furnish to the injured employee up to $10,000 for medical care, services, and supplies for the period immediately following the injury and so long as reasonably needed or until the employer files a written report with the Director denying the compensability of the injury, whichever is earlier. Clarifies that failure to give an employer notice of an employee's injury does not bar a claim for compensation if any person having authority in the interest of the employer had knowledge of the injury.","pending_committee_id":4754,"committee":{"committee_id":4754,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"name":"Labor and Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-27","committee_id":4754,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"name":"Labor and Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-20","action":"Introduced.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Passed First Reading.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-27","action":"Referred to LBT, JDC\/WAM.","chamber":"S","chamber_id":32,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":8346,"person_hash":"1fvf9475","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Karl Rhoads","first_name":"Karl","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rhoads","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-013","ftm_eid":12999428,"votesmart_id":68516,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":249223,"ballotpedia":"Karl_Rhoads","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19025,"person_hash":"codn6pdp","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Stanley Chang","first_name":"Stanley","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chang","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-009","ftm_eid":24812545,"votesmart_id":129305,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":462155,"ballotpedia":"Stanley_Chang","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8385,"person_hash":"wncze68c","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Gil Keith-agaran","first_name":"Gil","middle_name":"S Coloma","last_name":"Keith-agaran","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-005","ftm_eid":6511845,"votesmart_id":110947,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":274051,"ballotpedia":"Gilbert_Keith-Agaran","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":8440,"person_hash":"q86hnetn","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Michelle Kidani","first_name":"Michelle","middle_name":"N.","last_name":"Kidani","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-018","ftm_eid":6496273,"votesmart_id":109575,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":271958,"ballotpedia":"Michelle_Kidani","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"HB283","sast_bill_id":1671001}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":177233,"subject_name":"Workers' Compensation"},{"subject_id":363985,"subject_name":"Disability Benefits"},{"subject_id":363986,"subject_name":"Death Benefits"},{"subject_id":363987,"subject_name":"Notice by Employer"},{"subject_id":363988,"subject_name":"Medical Benefits"},{"subject_id":363989,"subject_name":"Knowledge of Injury"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2656861,"date":"2023-01-21","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/HI\/text\/SB918\/id\/2656861","state_link":"https:\/\/www.capitol.hawaii.gov\/sessions\/session2023\/bills\/SB918_.HTM","text_size":103595,"text_hash":"ade31ff015e3c04648615d7fbb5f93ed"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
