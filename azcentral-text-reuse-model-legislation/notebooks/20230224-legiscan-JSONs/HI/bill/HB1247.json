Establishes a definition of \"program\" and \"project\" to preempt the existing definitions under section 11-200.1-2, Hawaii Administrative Rules, and narrow the existing interpretation that requires analysis of tangentially related projects. Amends the applicability and requirements section of HEPA to clarify when multiple actions must be considered in the same environmental review document for the purposes of project segmentation. Expands the requirement that project opponents must exhaust their administrative remedies as a prerequisite to litigation to apply to environmental assessments and environmental impact statements. Retroactively applies to projects that received approval for their environmental assessment or environmental impact statement on or after August 9, 2019.","pending_committee_id":2043,"committee":{"committee_id":2043,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"name":"Housing"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-30","committee_id":2043,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"name":"Housing"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Pending introduction.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Introduced and Pass First Reading.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Referred to HSG\/EEP, JHA, FIN, referral sheet 3","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Bill scheduled to be heard by HSG\/EEP on Friday, 02-03-23 10:35AM in House conference room 325 VIA VIDEOCONFERENCE.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"The committee(s) on HSG\/EEP recommend(s) that the measure be deferred.","chamber":"H","chamber_id":31,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":20828,"person_hash":"0dwp5bid","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Troy Hashimoto","first_name":"Troy","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hashimoto","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-008","ftm_eid":22025734,"votesmart_id":180032,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":662035,"ballotpedia":"Troy_Hashimoto","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":24617,"person_hash":"ayvbxfpn","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Micah Aiu","first_name":"Micah","middle_name":"Pookela Kim","last_name":"Aiu","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-032","ftm_eid":55691526,"votesmart_id":208475,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"Micah_Pookela_Kim_Aiu","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":15164,"person_hash":"dom0yh8d","party_id":"1","state_id":11,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Justin Woodson","first_name":"Justin","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Woodson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-009","ftm_eid":16632975,"votesmart_id":144297,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":449999,"ballotpedia":"Justin_Woodson","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Same As","sast_bill_number":"SB1436","sast_bill_id":1678996}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":365597,"subject_name":"Hawaii Environmental Policy Act"},{"subject_id":178005,"subject_name":"Environmental Impact Statements"},{"subject_id":178004,"subject_name":"Environmental Assessments"},{"subject_id":177484,"subject_name":"Affordable Housing"},{"subject_id":365598,"subject_name":"Project Segmentation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2661634,"date":"2023-01-24","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/HI\/text\/HB1247\/id\/2661634","state_link":"https:\/\/www.capitol.hawaii.gov\/sessions\/session2023\/bills\/HB1247_.HTM","text_size":52388,"text_hash":"6a6076a54ea49a10cd3a99f2d5d0314a"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-03","time":"10:35","location":"Conference Room 325 VIA VIDEOCONFERENCE","description":"House Housing Hearing"}]}}
