Provides for additional information concerning a readoption action to be published with a notice of readoption. Requires an agency to conduct a hearing on a proposed readoption. Eliminates differences between readoption procedures applicable to environmental rules and other rules. Validates readoption actions that become effective before July 1, 2023.

Provides that the rules adopted by the environmental rules board concerning the disposal of CCR in landfills and surface impoundments: (1) shall be consistent with the federal CCR rule; (2) shall not impose a restriction or requirement that is more stringent than the corresponding restriction or requirement imposed under the federal CCR rule; and (3) shall not impose a restriction or requirement that is not imposed by the federal CCR rule. Defines \"legacy generation resource\" as an electric generating facility that is directly or indirectly owned by a corporation that was originally formed for the purpose of providing power to the federal government for use in the nation's defense or in furtherance of national interests.
