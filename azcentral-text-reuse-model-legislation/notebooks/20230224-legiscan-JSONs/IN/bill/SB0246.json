Defines \"aboveground storage tank\" as a tank that is at least 90% above the surface of the ground, that has a capacity of more than 1,500 gallons but not more than 20,000 gallons, and that is used for the bulk storage and distribution of motor fuel to retailers or used at an airport. Authorizes the use of the petroleum storage tank excess liability trust fund (ELTF) to provide a source of money to satisfy liabilities for corrective action involving aboveground storage tanks as well as underground petroleum storage tanks. Authorizes the use of the ELTF to provide reimbursement of 50% of costs of decommissioning or replacing underground petroleum storage tanks that meet the certain criteria. Requires the underground storage tank financial assurance board to adopt rules concerning this reimbursement program. Transfers, from the state fire marshal and the fire prevention and building safety commission to the Indiana department of environmental management (department) and the environmental rules board, the authority to issue certificates for people who work on underground storage tanks in Indiana. Provides that the commissioner of the department (commissioner) may not: (1) issue an order to secure compliance; or (2) proceed in court; to require the owner or operator of an underground storage tank to undertake corrective action with respect to a release of petroleum from the underground storage tank until the commissioner has received and reviewed the initial site characterization of the site of the release. Establishes requirements for initial site characterizations. Provides that, if a quantity of the released petroleum remains or may remain underground at the site, the commissioner is prohibited from: (1) requesting that the owner or operator execute a restrictive covenant applying to the site of the underground storage tank; (2) making a determination of no further action being required at the site of the underground storage tank; or (3) approving closure of the site of the underground storage tank; unless the commissioner has received and reviewed the initial site characterization. However, allows the commissioner to require the owner or operator to undertake corrective action without having received and reviewed the initial site characterization if the commissioner reasonably believes that the release from the underground storage tank creates a threat to human health or the environment sufficient to necessitate an order or proceeding before the initial site characterization is submitted to the department of environmental management.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":2693,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Environmental Affairs"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":1310,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Authored by Senator Niemeyer","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Environmental Affairs","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Committee report: amend do pass adopted; reassigned to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Senator Gaskill added as second author","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"Committee report: amend do pass, adopted","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14765,"person_hash":"72meg5za","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rick Niemeyer","first_name":"Rick","middle_name":"","last_name":"Niemeyer","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-006","ftm_eid":10245978,"votesmart_id":131192,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":395736,"ballotpedia":"Rick_Niemeyer","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19711,"person_hash":"tyertoml","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Gaskill","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gaskill","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-026","ftm_eid":12409841,"votesmart_id":178161,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":654855,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Gaskill","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362762,"subject_name":"ADMINISTRATION, STATE DEPARTMENT OF"},{"subject_id":362776,"subject_name":"ENVIRONMENT generally"},{"subject_id":362761,"subject_name":"HEALTH generally"},{"subject_id":362922,"subject_name":"OIL AND GAS"},{"subject_id":362777,"subject_name":"ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, DEPARTMENT AND AGENCIES"},{"subject_id":362923,"subject_name":"FIRE MARSHALS; DEPARTMENT OF FIRE AND BUILDING SERVICES"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2634839,"date":"2023-01-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0246\/id\/2634839","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/246\/#1.INTR","text_size":831744,"text_hash":"91fcb6b76cd0254de4dc1358a4bfe6a5"},{"doc_id":2685897,"date":"2023-02-07","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0246\/id\/2685897","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/246\/#2.COMS","text_size":816354,"text_hash":"fbf598345b23f267137b6342876ff492"},{"doc_id":2716240,"date":"2023-02-23","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0246\/id\/2716240","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/246\/#3.COMS","text_size":827056,"text_hash":"d2ee30bbb395f14b7e2093deba92d516"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-30","time":"10:00","location":"Room 431","description":"Senate Environmental Affairs Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-06","time":"09:00","location":"Room 431","description":"Senate Environmental Affairs Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-23","time":"09:00","location":"Room 431","description":"Senate Appropriations Hearing"}]}}
