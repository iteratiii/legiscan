Provides that certain consumers may submit proper identification to a credit reporting agency, request certain information, and submit a dispute with the credit reporting agency. Specifies that if a consumer provides proper identification, the credit reporting agency shall: (1) verify the consumer's identity with the federal Social Security Administration; (2) conduct a search of all files maintained by the consumer reporting agency; (3) provide the consumer with certain information from the Social Security number search; (4) investigate a dispute submitted by the consumer; and (5) take all lawful actions to remove the consumer's verified Social Security number from files not associated with the consumer.
