Requires a public utility to notify the Indiana utility regulatory commission (IURC) if: (1) the public utility intends or decides to retire, sell, or transfer an electric generation facility with a capacity of at least 80 megawatts; and (2) the retirement, sale, or transfer: (A) was not set forth in; or (B) is to take place on a date earlier than the date specified in; the public utility's short term action plan in the public utility's most recently filed integrated resource plan (IRP). Provides that upon receiving such notice from a public utility, the IURC shall consider and may investigate the public utility's intention or decision to retire, sell, or transfer the electric generation facility. Provides that in considering the public utility's intention or decision, the commission shall examine the impact the retirement, sale, or transfer would have on the public utility's ability to meet: (1) the public utility's planning reserve margin requirements or other federal reliability requirements; and (2) the reliability adequacy metrics set forth in Indiana law. Provides that if the retirement, sale, or transfer was not set forth in, or is to take place earlier than specified in, the public utility's short term action plan in the public utility's most recently filed IRP, the IURC shall not permit the public utility's depreciation rates to be amended to reflect the accelerated date for the retirement, sale, or transfer of the electric generation asset unless the IURC finds that such an adjustment is necessary to ensure the ability of the public utility to provide reliable service to its customers, and that the unamended depreciation rates would cause an unjust and unreasonable impact on the public utility and its ratepayers. Authorizes the IURC to adopt a general administrative order to implement these provisions. Provides that the bill's provisions do not apply to: (1) the retirement, sale, or transfer of a public utility's electric generation facility if the retirement, sale, or transfer is necessary for the public utility to comply with a federal consent decree; or (2) an electric generation facility that generates electricity for sale exclusively to the wholesale market. Provides that the bill's provisions expire July 1, 2026.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":2722,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Utilities"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Authored by Senators Leising and Glick","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Utilities","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Senator Koch added as second author","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Senator Tomes added as coauthor","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"Committee report: amend do pass, adopted","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":5612,"person_hash":"3sj5v021","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jean Leising","first_name":"Jean","middle_name":"","last_name":"Leising","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-042","ftm_eid":6625456,"votesmart_id":357,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":270782,"ballotpedia":"Jean_Leising","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":5483,"person_hash":"9e5n3eww","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Eric Koch","first_name":"Eric","middle_name":"Allan","last_name":"Koch","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-044","ftm_eid":6592338,"votesmart_id":34369,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":212343,"ballotpedia":"Eric_Koch","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":10585,"person_hash":"hqlm8zq7","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Glick","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Glick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-013","ftm_eid":6700210,"votesmart_id":128689,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":313085,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Glick","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":10581,"person_hash":"cfior0c4","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"James Tomes","first_name":"James","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tomes","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-049","ftm_eid":6659181,"votesmart_id":34052,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":289903,"ballotpedia":"Jim_Tomes","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[],"texts":[{"doc_id":2640095,"date":"2023-01-13","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0009\/id\/2640095","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/9\/#1.INTR","text_size":135624,"text_hash":"2576b4fbb8d886d6af303a9e1a7d9ae1"},{"doc_id":2716219,"date":"2023-02-23","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0009\/id\/2716219","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/9\/#2.COMS","text_size":154744,"text_hash":"66a9d80a66da21bc05c36c446e758e57"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-23","time":"09:00","location":"Room 130","description":"Senate Utilities Hearing"}]}}
