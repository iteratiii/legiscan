Removes consideration of income and countable resources in determining an individual's eligibility for participation in the Medicaid buy-in program (program). Requires the office of the secretary of family and social services (office of the secretary) to apply for a state plan amendment or waiver to implement this provision. Prohibits the office of the secretary from considering resources and whether the individual participated in a specified program in determining the individual's eligibility or continuous eligibility for the program. Allows a recipient's participation in an employment network recognized by the federal Social Security Administration to qualify as participating with an approved provider of employment services. Changes minimum and maximum premiums that a recipient must pay. Requires that the premium scale be promulgated by administrative rule. Allows the office of the secretary to annually review the premium amount that a recipient must pay in the program. (Current law requires annual review of the premium amount.) Specifies changes in circumstances that must result in an adjustment of the premium. Specifies that a recipient in the program is eligible for the same services as offered in the Medicaid program. States that an individual's participation in the program does not preclude the individual from participating in a Medicaid waiver program. Specifies that a recipient of the program may simultaneously participate in a Medicaid waiver program and requires the office of the secretary to individually determine eligibility for both programs based on the individual's medical need requirements.","pending_committee_id":3128,"committee":{"committee_id":3128,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Family & Children Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":3128,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Family & Children Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Authored by Senator Yoder","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Family and Children Services","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Senator Ford Jon added as coauthor","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":22087,"person_hash":"dcvlp4vo","party_id":"1","state_id":14,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Shelli Yoder","first_name":"Shelli","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yoder","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-040","ftm_eid":17657992,"votesmart_id":135982,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":395644,"ballotpedia":"Shelli_Yoder","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16532,"person_hash":"xbkmic1p","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jon Ford","first_name":"Jon","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ford","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-038","ftm_eid":21078152,"votesmart_id":148534,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":484121,"ballotpedia":"Jon_Ford","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362736,"subject_name":"WELFARE, Medicaid"},{"subject_id":362820,"subject_name":"FAMILY AND SOCIAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION"},{"subject_id":363048,"subject_name":"LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, Social Security"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2636971,"date":"2023-01-12","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0310\/id\/2636971","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/310\/#1.INTR","text_size":157691,"text_hash":"f822772cfbffaa30327b9b074781fed1"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
