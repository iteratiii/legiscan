Requires a multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) providing benefits for employers that are public entities to provide each public entity that has 51 or more employees covered under the arrangement access to claims data specific to that public entity.  Provides that, within a reasonable time after receiving a written request from a participating employer that is a public entity, a MEWA must provide to the public entity certain loss history information concerning the benefits provided by the MEWA for the public entity. Also imposes the duty to provide the loss history information upon the insurer providing the group insurance policy if the MEWA provides benefits for the public entity through a group insurance policy and upon the health maintenance organization if the MEWA provides benefits for the public entity through a group health maintenance contract. Provides that a policy of stop loss insurance issued by a reinsurer to a MEWA providing benefits for a public entity must cover claims submitted within the timely filing limit of the policy and the policy provisions of the stop loss coverage. Prohibits the department of insurance from adopting or enforcing any rule that would reduce the timely filing limit specified within the policy and the policy provisions of the stop loss coverage. Makes the violation of the requirements relating to a MEWA that provides benefits for a public entity an unfair method of competition and an unfair and deceptive act and practice for which the insurance commissioner may issue a cease and desist order, impose a civil penalty, and suspend or revoke a MEWA's certificate of registration.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":1294,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Insurance"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Authored by Representative Carbaugh","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Insurance","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Committee report: amend do pass, adopted","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Amendment #1 (Vermilion) prevailed; voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Amendment #3 (Fleming) failed; Roll Call 162: yeas 28, nays 69","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Second reading: amended, ordered engrossed","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Third reading: passed; Roll Call 181: yeas 67, nays 28","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Senate sponsor: Senator Raatz","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-22","action":"Referred to the Senate","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":14762,"person_hash":"pcgjbqb4","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Martin Carbaugh","first_name":"Martin","middle_name":"","last_name":"Carbaugh","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-081","ftm_eid":10246056,"votesmart_id":135309,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":395905,"ballotpedia":"Martin_Carbaugh","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16536,"person_hash":"8mvi9az2","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jeff Raatz","first_name":"Jeff","middle_name":"","last_name":"Raatz","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-027","ftm_eid":21077620,"votesmart_id":148529,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":486664,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Raatz","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":3,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362921,"subject_name":"WELFARE generally"},{"subject_id":362795,"subject_name":"INSURANCE generally"},{"subject_id":362804,"subject_name":"CIVIL ACTIONS, Penalties"},{"subject_id":362941,"subject_name":"INSURANCE, State Department and Agencies"},{"subject_id":367282,"subject_name":"INSURANCE, Insurance Companies, Agents, and Brokers"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2642377,"date":"2023-01-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1410\/id\/2642377","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1410\/#1.INTR","text_size":244466,"text_hash":"5014d3b1edda8ec382ca86c08a23bb9b"},{"doc_id":2704371,"date":"2023-02-16","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1410\/id\/2704371","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1410\/#2.COMH","text_size":273829,"text_hash":"8067ddae5c03887f39f0f04463717b65"},{"doc_id":2710241,"date":"2023-02-20","type":"Engrossed","type_id":4,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1410\/id\/2710241","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1410\/#3.ENGH","text_size":286582,"text_hash":"c0ee72ca3dc9809d3a9066f2f429334d"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1256440,"date":"2023-02-20","desc":"House - Amendment #3 (Fleming) failed","yea":28,"nay":69,"nv":0,"absent":3,"total":100,"passed":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/rollcall\/HB1410\/id\/1256440","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1410\/#H162"},{"roll_call_id":1257168,"date":"2023-02-21","desc":"House - Third reading","yea":67,"nay":28,"nv":1,"absent":4,"total":100,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/rollcall\/HB1410\/id\/1257168","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1410\/#H181"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-15","time":"08:30","location":"Room 156-A","description":"House Insurance Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-15","time":"08:30","location":"Room 156-B","description":"House Insurance Hearing"}]}}
