Repeals the provision that requires the county surveyor to make a survey of certain land, if an assessor and a landowner fail to agree on the amount of land included in assessments involving rights-of-way, levees, and public drainage ditches. Provides that a survey must be done if an assessor and a landowner fail to agree on the amount of land in those circumstances, and: (1) requires the landowner to provide written notice of the disagreement to the assessor; (2) requires the survey to be completed within six months from the date of the landowner's notice; (3) allows the landowner to elect to choose the surveyor to conduct the survey (if the landowner does not choose a surveyor, the county surveyor is required to conduct the survey); and (4) specifies the party who is required to pay for the survey. Provides that the attorney general, upon written request of a county assessor, may authorize the chief administrative officer of the office of judicial administration to hire private counsel to represent the county assessor: (1) in a judicial review initiated by the county assessor for review of a final determination of the Indiana board of tax review regarding the assessment or exemption of tangible property; and (2) in a judicial review seeking relief from the tax court to establish that the Indiana board of tax review rendered a decision that was: (A) an abuse of discretion; (B) arbitrary and capricious; (C) contrary to substantial or reliable evidence; or (D) contrary to law (the office of the attorney general may not represent the assessor in these actions under current law).","pending_committee_id":1298,"committee":{"committee_id":1298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Local Government"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":1298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Local Government"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Authored by Representative GiaQuinta","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Local Government","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":5569,"person_hash":"hq2pneab","party_id":"1","state_id":14,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Philip GiaQuinta","first_name":"Philip","middle_name":"","last_name":"GiaQuinta","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-080","ftm_eid":13000429,"votesmart_id":58738,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":258099,"ballotpedia":"Phil_GiaQuinta","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362744,"subject_name":"PROPERTY TAXES, Assessments, Notices, and Penalties"},{"subject_id":363432,"subject_name":"ENGINEERS AND LAND SURVEYORS"},{"subject_id":362789,"subject_name":"LAND AND LANDOWNERS"},{"subject_id":362825,"subject_name":"ASSESSORS"},{"subject_id":362898,"subject_name":"ATTORNEY GENERAL"},{"subject_id":367493,"subject_name":"TAX REVIEW, INDIANA BOARD OF"},{"subject_id":367542,"subject_name":"ARBITRATION"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2642462,"date":"2023-01-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1441\/id\/2642462","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1441\/#1.INTR","text_size":129997,"text_hash":"7faffa6e6eae06eb27b2c9be28ed8250"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
