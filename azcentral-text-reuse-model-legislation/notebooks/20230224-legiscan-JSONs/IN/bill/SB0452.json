Amends as follows a provision in the act that authorizes a federal savings bank to voluntarily register with the department of financial institutions (department) for the purpose of sponsoring licensed mortgage loan originators under certain circumstances: (1) Authorizes any person (rather than just a federal savings bank) that meets the requirements set forth in the provision to sponsor one or more licensed mortgage loan originators. (2) Eliminates a requirement that a sponsored individual must sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance under an exclusive written agreement for a licensed insurance company that is a subsidiary of a company that also owns or controls the federal savings bank. (3) Provides that a sponsored individual must be engaged solely as a third party loan processor or underwriter.

Requires a credit union that is classified as adequately capitalized or lower to increase the dollar amount of its net worth on a quarterly basis by an amount equal to at least 0.1% of the credit union's total assets until the credit union is classified as well capitalized. Sets forth different: (1) mandatory supervisory requirements or restrictions; and (2) discretionary supervisory requirements or restrictions (to be imposed by the director of the department); with respect to a credit union, depending on the credit union's classification as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. Directs the department to use specified statutory authority to adopt emergency rules not later than June 30, 2024, to amend the department's rule concerning mortgage lenders and originators in order to: (1) conform the rule to the bill's provisions concerning the sponsorship of licensed mortgage loan originators to engage solely as a third party loan processor or underwriter; and (2) establish a rule to allow certain persons to sponsor one or more mortgage loan originators, who are not employees of the sponsoring person, to perform mortgage loan originator activities exclusively for the sponsoring person under certain prescribed conditions.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":1324,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Insurance & Financial Institutions"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Authored by Senator Bassler","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Insurance and Financial Institutions","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Committee report: do pass, adopted","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Second reading: ordered engrossed","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Senator Gaskill added as second author","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"Third reading: passed; Roll Call 94: yeas 49, nays 0","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-09","action":"House sponsor: Representative Speedy","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Referred to the House","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16531,"person_hash":"lj553xa0","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Eric Bassler","first_name":"Eric","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Bassler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-039","ftm_eid":12177943,"votesmart_id":148215,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":486666,"ballotpedia":"Eric_Bassler","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19711,"person_hash":"tyertoml","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Gaskill","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gaskill","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-026","ftm_eid":12409841,"votesmart_id":178161,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":654855,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Gaskill","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":11396,"person_hash":"3xavxz2f","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Speedy","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Speedy","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-090","ftm_eid":6682305,"votesmart_id":73023,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":289921,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Speedy","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":3,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362840,"subject_name":"CONSUMER CREDIT AND PROTECTION (including UCCC)"},{"subject_id":363053,"subject_name":"FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS"},{"subject_id":363730,"subject_name":"FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DEPARTMENT OF"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2649691,"date":"2023-01-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0452\/id\/2649691","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/452\/#1.INTR","text_size":775160,"text_hash":"aeee31c5bcebfe1f87f906330567f652"},{"doc_id":2681144,"date":"2023-02-02","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0452\/id\/2681144","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/452\/#2.COMS","text_size":792592,"text_hash":"454bc3042d1114923dff51910e27dc7a"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1247073,"date":"2023-02-09","desc":"Senate - Third reading","yea":49,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":1,"total":50,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/rollcall\/SB0452\/id\/1247073","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/452\/#S94"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-01","time":"09:00","location":"Room 130","description":"Senate Insurance and Financial Institutions Hearing"}]}}
