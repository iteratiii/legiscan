Establishes a state policy favoring beneficial uses of coal combustion residuals (CCR). Provides that the rules of the environmental rules board may not allow CCR to be disposed of if, after the disposal, any of the CCR: (1) would be within a 500 year flood plain; (2) would be in contact with ground water; (3) could migrate into the uppermost aquifer; (4) would be left in an unstable area; or (5) would be in a seismic impact zone. Requires that the CCR disposal rules of the environmental rules board and the state permit program implementing the federal CCR rule be at least as protective and comprehensive as the federal CCR rule. Defines \"closure in place\" and prohibits the department of environmental management from approving the closure in place of a CCR surface impoundment if: (1) the CCR surface impoundment is within a 500 year flood plain; (2) any of the CCR disposed of in the CCR surface impoundment would be in contact with ground water; or (3) CCR could migrate into the uppermost aquifer after the closure in place. Makes corresponding changes and a technical correction.","pending_committee_id":2693,"committee":{"committee_id":2693,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Environmental Affairs"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":2693,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Environmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Authored by Senators Pol and Glick","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Environmental Affairs","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23013,"person_hash":"94izuboz","party_id":"1","state_id":14,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Rodney Pol","first_name":"Rodney","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pol","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-004","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":200559,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":790232,"ballotpedia":"Rodney_Pol_Jr.","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":10585,"person_hash":"hqlm8zq7","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Susan Glick","first_name":"Susan","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Glick","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-013","ftm_eid":6700210,"votesmart_id":128689,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":313085,"ballotpedia":"Susan_Glick","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362764,"subject_name":"MINES AND MINERALS"},{"subject_id":362763,"subject_name":"ENERGY"},{"subject_id":362777,"subject_name":"ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, DEPARTMENT AND AGENCIES"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2647176,"date":"2023-01-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0399\/id\/2647176","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/399\/#1.INTR","text_size":148840,"text_hash":"ffb72d4ed77d94788692dd7ab738c1e6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
