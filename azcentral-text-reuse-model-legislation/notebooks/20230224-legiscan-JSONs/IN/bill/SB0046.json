Authorizes a county fiscal body to adopt an ordinance to provide a credit against property tax liability for qualified individuals. Defines a \"qualified individual\" for purposes of the credit. Provides that the ordinance may designate: (1) all of the territory of the county; or (2) one or more specific geographic territories within the county; as an area in which qualified individuals may apply for the credit. Provides that the credit amount is equal to the amount by which property taxes on the property increased by at least 2% but not more than 5% from the prior year (excluding any property tax liability imposed in a voter approved referendum levy). Provides that the credit does not affect the allocation of taxes to a referendum fund. Requires a qualified individual who desires to claim the credit to file a certified statement with the county auditor. Provides that the county auditor shall apply the credit in succeeding years after the certified statement is filed unless the auditor determines that the individual is no longer eligible for the credit or the county fiscal body rescinds the ordinance. Provides a penalty for wrongly receiving the credit that is the same as the penalty for wrongly receiving the homestead standard deduction.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":1335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Tax and Fiscal
