Allows a state agency to adopt a policy governing electronic meetings conducted by a board or committee of the agency, if the board or committee has not adopted a policy. Allows the reinstatement of a professional license that was retired, inactive, or surrendered (inactive) if the applicant meets the requirements for a delinquent or lapsed license. Provides that provisions regarding reinstatement of a retired license do not apply if the license was retired while a complaint or investigation regarding professional conduct was pending. Provides that the reinstatement law applies to all licenses that were inactive for more than three years. Requires, for purposes of the license reinstatement law, that each board make available a list of standards that require a personal appearance before the board. Requires a provider of a continuing education course to: (1) obtain approval of the course from the licensing board; and (2) provide the licensing board or agency with a certificate showing that a practitioner completed a course. Eliminates random continuing education audits of practitioners. Adds certain nonhealth professions to the professions that an out-of-state applicant may use to apply for license under the general reciprocity law. Provides that if a board does not act on an application within one year for an applicant who holds a provisional license or provisional certificate under the reciprocity law, the professional licensing agency shall issue the applicant a license or certificate. Allows the use of certain titles by an individual who is enrolled in or has graduated from a school of architecture or an accredited curriculum of landscape architecture.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":1293,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Government and Regulatory
