Requires a public utility company that owns or operates wind power devices after a change in ownership of the wind power devices to report, when filing its first statement of value and description of property with the department of local government finance (department), the valuation of the devices at the same valuation amount that the previous owner reported on the previous owner's last annual report before the change in ownership. Requires a public utility company that owns or operates wind power devices after a change in ownership of the wind power devices to notify the department in a timely manner of the change in ownership. Requires the new owner, for years subsequent to the first year after the change in ownership, to calculate and report the valuation of the wind power devices in accordance with: (1) the statute concerning the taxation of public utility companies; and (2) rules prescribed by the department. Provides that for any year subsequent to the first year after the change in ownership of a wind power device, the department, in determining the just value of the property, shall not consider valuations determined by another governmental agency. Requires the department to make necessary conforming changes to the annual report form. Requires the Indiana utility regulatory commission to include a provision in an order declining to exercise jurisdiction over a public utility company that: (1) owns or operates one or more wind power devices; or (2) plans to own or operate one or more wind power devices; requiring the public utility to notify the department of any change in ownership of the wind power devices.
