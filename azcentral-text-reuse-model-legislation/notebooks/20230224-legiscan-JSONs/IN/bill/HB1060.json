Repeals a statute relating to the dissolution of a small town (a town with a population of less than 500) and included towns in Marion County. Restates this statute and additionally provides that if the county election board of the county in which the greatest percentage of the population of a small town is located finds that the town has not elected town officers during the preceding 10 years, that county election board shall certify that fact to the county executive of each county in which the town is located. Removes from the statute as a reason for dissolving a small town that the town has not had a \"functioning town government\" during the preceding 10 years. Provides the following if a small town is dissolved: (1) The property owned by the dissolved town after payment of debts and liabilities shall be disposed of by the county executive of the county in which the property is located. (2) Any money remaining after payment of the dissolved town's debts and liabilities shall be deposited in the general fund of each county in which the town was located, in proportion to the assessed value of the dissolved town located in each county. (3) Beginning with the date of the town's dissolution, the following apply: any town ordinance relating to the town's budget, tax rates, and tax levies for the calendar year is void; a budget, tax rate, and tax levy may not be certified for the dissolved town; any distribution of funds due to the town from the state shall be paid to the county; and the county shall deposit any distribution payments made by the state in the county's general fund. (4) Dissolution of the town does not affect the validity of a contract to which the town is a party. (5) After dissolution, the books and records of the dissolved town become the property of the county executive of the county in which the greatest assessed value of the dissolved town was located. (6) Provides that if a dissolved small town was located in more than one county, the county executives may enter into appropriate agreements concerning the disposition of the property of the dissolved town, access to the town records, and other matters considered relevant by the county executives of the respective counties.","pending_committee_id":1298,"committee":{"committee_id":1298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Local Government"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":1298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Local Government"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Authored by Representative Engleman","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Local Government","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Representative Payne Z added as coauthor","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18546,"person_hash":"4lb3nt4s","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Karen Engleman","first_name":"Karen","middle_name":"","last_name":"Engleman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-070","ftm_eid":38525992,"votesmart_id":167563,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":568979,"ballotpedia":"Karen_Engleman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22048,"person_hash":"zt4nuzjy","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Zach Payne","first_name":"Zach","middle_name":"","last_name":"Payne","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-066","ftm_eid":48871539,"votesmart_id":148158,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":732760,"ballotpedia":"Zach_Payne","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362778,"subject_name":"CITIES AND TOWNS"},{"subject_id":362779,"subject_name":"COUNTY GOVERNMENT"},{"subject_id":363098,"subject_name":"ELECTIONS, State and Local Boards"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2625802,"date":"2023-01-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1060\/id\/2625802","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1060\/#1.INTR","text_size":203656,"text_hash":"9086d0db975947cf8b0213eb7df30cd2"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
