Sets the income eligibility requirements for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program at a specified percentage of the federal income poverty level. Requires the division of family resources (division) to amend the state TANF plan or take any other action necessary to implement the income requirements. Increases certain payment amounts under the TANF program. Requires the payments to be annually adjusted using the Social Security cost of living adjustment rate, but provides that the total adjustment in a year must be reduced to the extent the adjustment would result in the transfer to the Child Care and Development Fund grant program being less than the maximum allowable transfer under federal law. Authorizes emergency rulemaking concerning the payments. Repeals provisions: (1) regarding TANF eligibility of a child born more than 10 months after the child's family qualifies for TANF assistance; (2) encouraging a family that receives TANF assistance to receive family planning counseling; and (3) requiring the division to apply a percentage reduction to the total needs of TANF applicants and recipients in computing TANF benefits.
