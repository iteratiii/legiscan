Establishes in the Indiana Code article concerning regulated businesses a new chapter governing third party food delivery services. Defines a \"third party food delivery service\" as a person that uses an online modality or platform to offer or arrange for the sale, and same-day delivery or pick up, of food and beverages prepared or provided by one or more covered establishments. Defines a \"covered establishment\" as a: (1) restaurant; or (2) food service establishment; that offers, in a single transaction over the Internet, whether directly or through a third party food delivery service, the sale and same-day delivery or pick up of food and beverages to customers. Prohibits a third party food delivery service from providing any services related to facilitating, processing, or delivering an online order for a covered establishment unless the covered establishment expressly agrees to allow the third party food delivery service to provide those services. Requires a third party food delivery service to terminate a service contract with a covered establishment not later than 72 hours after the covered establishment provides notice of the covered establishment's decision to terminate the contract. Provides that if a third party food delivery service violates the bill's provisions with respect to a covered establishment, the covered establishment may bring an action in a court with jurisdiction. Provides that if a covered establishment prevails in an action for a violation, the covered establishment is entitled to liquidated damages of not more than $50,000 per transaction.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":1727,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Authored by Representative Greene","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Representative Olthoff added as coauthor","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Representatives Morris and Lehman added as coauthors","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Committee report: amend do pass, adopted","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"Amendment #1 (Lehman) prevailed; voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"Second reading: amended, ordered engrossed","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":24158,"person_hash":"3ehkkjcx","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robb Greene","first_name":"Robb","middle_name":"","last_name":"Greene","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-047","ftm_eid":54902826,"votesmart_id":201971,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"Robb_Greene","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16702,"person_hash":"rq4ygpky","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Julie Olthoff","first_name":"Julie","middle_name":"","last_name":"Olthoff","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-019","ftm_eid":21078191,"votesmart_id":149618,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":486738,"ballotpedia":"Julie_Olthoff","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":10576,"person_hash":"58l0h3px","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Robert Morris","first_name":"Robert","middle_name":"","last_name":"Morris","suffix":"","nickname":"Bob","district":"HD-084","ftm_eid":6697099,"votesmart_id":127376,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":300041,"ballotpedia":"Bob_Morris","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":5557,"person_hash":"bmfibp4m","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Matthew Lehman","first_name":"Matthew","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Lehman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":6675237,"votesmart_id":83983,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":270740,"ballotpedia":"Matthew_Lehman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":363234,"subject_name":"FOODS; FOOD AND BEVERAGE TAXES"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2634833,"date":"2023-01-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1279\/id\/2634833","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1279\/#1.INTR","text_size":301652,"text_hash":"232aedf0441074a5e3553e6b74b32576"},{"doc_id":2711623,"date":"2023-02-21","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1279\/id\/2711623","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1279\/#2.COMH","text_size":148454,"text_hash":"264f913a87b2885adb9fab73ae93fa92"},{"doc_id":2716200,"date":"2023-02-23","type":"Engrossed","type_id":4,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1279\/id\/2716200","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1279\/#3.ENGH","text_size":150188,"text_hash":"a0fe2b7319bcde0904f99056f642ca96"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-15","time":"13:30","location":"Room 156-C","description":"House Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-21","time":"08:30","location":"Room 156-A","description":"House Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development Hearing"}]}}
