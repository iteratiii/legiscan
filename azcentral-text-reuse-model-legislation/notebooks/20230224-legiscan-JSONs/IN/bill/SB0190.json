Amends current requirements for a collaborative agreement between a physician and a physician assistant with the following: (1) the collaborative agreement must include limitations; (2) the collaborative agreement must set forth the method of collaboration between the physician and physician assistant; and (3) the collaborative agreement must be signed, updated annually, and made available to the medical licensing board of Indiana upon request. Amends the definition of \"prescriber\" for purposes of electronically transmitted prescriptions for controlled substances, overdose intervention drugs, and telehealth services and prescriptions. Provides that a written collaborative agreement between a physician assistant, who is employed by a certain health care facility or center, and a particular collaborating physician is not required. Requires a physician assistant employed by a certain health care facility or center to enter into a practice agreement with the health care facility or center that employs the physician assistant. Eliminates: (1) a prohibition against a physician collaborating with more than four physician assistants at the same time; (2) a requirement that a physician submit a collaborative agreement to the medical licensing board; and (3) a requirement that a collaborating physician and physician assistant submit a list of locations the physician and physician assistant will practice to the medical licensing board.","pending_committee_id":1321,"committee":{"committee_id":1321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Health and Provider Services"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":1321,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Health and Provider Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Authored by Senator Charbonneau","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Health and Provider Services","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":5580,"person_hash":"juho0g1y","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ed Charbonneau","first_name":"Ed","middle_name":"","last_name":"Charbonneau","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-005","ftm_eid":6675181,"votesmart_id":88705,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":257496,"ballotpedia":"Ed_Charbonneau","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362786,"subject_name":"LICENSES AND LICENSING"},{"subject_id":362841,"subject_name":"PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS"},{"subject_id":362787,"subject_name":"PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS"},{"subject_id":362788,"subject_name":"HEALTH, Health Care Professionals"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2632460,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0190\/id\/2632460","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/190\/#1.INTR","text_size":138869,"text_hash":"8c620f4c75dd41d4e1fd6d3762633a6b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
