Reduces the required percentage amount of the motor vehicle highway account distributions that counties, cities, and towns must use for the construction, reconstruction, and preservation of highways from 50% in current law to 40% in calendar years beginning January 1, 2024, and ending December 31, 2025. Provides that, for a period in which the reduction applies, the term \"preservation\" includes both snow removal and expenditures for deicing road salt or similar deicing agents. Requires counties, cities, and towns that apply the reduced required percentage amounts authorized under the bill to submit to the local technical assistance program (LTAP) at Purdue University in conjunction with the Indiana department of transportation a detailed itemization of the uses of the funds in the calendar year that were for: (1) purposes other than construction, reconstruction, and preservation; and (2) preservation that included only snow removal and expenditures for deicing road salt or similar deicing agents. Requires the LTAP to present a statewide aggregate report of the results received from counties, cities, and towns to the budget committee for each year.","pending_committee_id":1302,"committee":{"committee_id":1302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Roads and Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":1302,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Roads and Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Coauthored by Representatives Aylesworth and Snow","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Authored by Representative Abbott","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Roads and Transportation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19647,"person_hash":"1qequxb4","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"David Abbott","first_name":"David","middle_name":"","last_name":"Abbott","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-082","ftm_eid":44857908,"votesmart_id":84404,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":654968,"ballotpedia":"David_Abbott_(Indiana)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16530,"person_hash":"z5or8e1m","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Micheal Aylesworth","first_name":"Micheal","middle_name":"","last_name":"Aylesworth","suffix":"","nickname":"Mike","district":"HD-011","ftm_eid":21078183,"votesmart_id":149616,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":486730,"ballotpedia":"Michael_J._Aylesworth","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22453,"person_hash":"9ck6xm6k","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Craig Snow","first_name":"Craig","middle_name":"","last_name":"Snow","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-018","ftm_eid":48871437,"votesmart_id":189715,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":731040,"ballotpedia":"Craig_Snow","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":362778,"subject_name":"CITIES AND TOWNS"},{"subject_id":362779,"subject_name":"COUNTY GOVERNMENT"},{"subject_id":362816,"subject_name":"HIGHWAYS AND ROADS, Highway Finance"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2629921,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1174\/id\/2629921","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1174\/#1.INTR","text_size":118020,"text_hash":"cd2a387ea41e602fa13aaec771e2def0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
