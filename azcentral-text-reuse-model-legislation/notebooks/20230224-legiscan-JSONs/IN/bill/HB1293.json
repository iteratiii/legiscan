Provides that if a person dies under certain circumstances in a county that is not the county where the incident occurred resulting in the death, the county coroner where the death occurred may not bill the county where the incident occurred for the costs of the autopsy, unless the coroners of both counties agree as to the necessity of an autopsy. Provides the following: (1) Allows a coroner to determine the means of copying an original record of the coroner. (2) Allows a coroner to destroy or transfer the original record at the time determined by the coroner after copying the record. Provides that a coroner is immune from criminal liability for destroying a public record if the coroner acts in accordance with the coroner's authority to copy and destroy the coroner's records. Removes a requirement that the county fix the compensation of a coroner who is a licensed physician at 1.5 times the compensation of a coroner who is not a licensed physician for coroners who are elected or reelected in the 2024 general election and thereafter.","pending_committee_id":1327,"committee":{"committee_id":1327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Local Government"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":1298,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Local Government"},{"date":"2023-02-23","committee_id":1327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Local Government"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Authored by Representative VanNatter","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Local Government","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Committee report: amend do pass, adopted","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Second reading: ordered engrossed","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Senate sponsor: Senator Mishler","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Third reading: passed; Roll Call 42: yeas 94, nays 0","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Referred to the Senate","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Local Government","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":10577,"person_hash":"cnbnqyvb","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Heath VanNatter","first_name":"Heath","middle_name":"","last_name":"VanNatter","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-038","ftm_eid":6682164,"votesmart_id":109780,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":265369,"ballotpedia":"Heath_VanNatter","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":5627,"person_hash":"kg7qj7ch","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Ryan Mishler","first_name":"Ryan","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Mishler","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-009","ftm_eid":6659155,"votesmart_id":33992,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":227285,"ballotpedia":"Ryan_Mishler","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":3,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":366426,"subject_name":"CORONERS"},{"subject_id":362751,"subject_name":"DEATH"},{"subject_id":362788,"subject_name":"HEALTH, Health Care Professionals"},{"subject_id":363042,"subject_name":"HEALTH, Medical Records and Bills"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2634829,"date":"2023-01-11","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1293\/id\/2634829","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1293\/#1.INTR","text_size":86252,"text_hash":"557be71fe617f983e713af9738fd9fdd"},{"doc_id":2660574,"date":"2023-01-24","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1293\/id\/2660574","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1293\/#2.COMH","text_size":164404,"text_hash":"22e45d216a2b71e674dde8cdacb4ecb5"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1237999,"date":"2023-01-30","desc":"House - Third reading","yea":94,"nay":0,"nv":1,"absent":5,"total":100,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/rollcall\/HB1293\/id\/1237999","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1293\/#H42"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-24","time":"08:30","location":"Room 156-C","description":"House Local Government Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-03-09","time":"00:00","location":"Room 233","description":"Senate Local Government Hearing"}]}}
