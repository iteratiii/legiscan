Provides that if the county executive of a county authorizes the furnishing of financial assistance to a community intellectual and developmental disability center (CIDD), the county fiscal body is required, upon request of the county executive, to annually appropriate an amount of money from the county's general fund that is not less than the amount that would be collected from an annual rate of $0.0025 on each $100 of taxable property within the county to provide the financial assistance to the CIDD. (Under current law, a county fiscal body may (rather than shall) make the annual appropriation.) Requires the county auditor to distribute the amounts appropriated by the county fiscal body to furnish financial assistance to a CIDD first before making any other distributions of appropriated amounts from the county's general fund. Makes corresponding changes to provisions that authorize two or more counties to furnish financial assistance to a CIDD that is organized to provide services in more than one county and that authorize a county to furnish a share of financial assistance to a CIDD in certain circumstances.","pending_committee_id":1335,"committee":{"committee_id":1335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Tax and Fiscal Policy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":1327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Local Government"},{"date":"2023-01-30","committee_id":1335,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Tax and Fiscal Policy"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Authored by Senator Bohacek","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Local Government","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Committee report: amend do pass adopted; reassigned to Committee on Tax and Fiscal Policy","chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17995,"person_hash":"e30lete6","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mike Bohacek","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bohacek","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-008","ftm_eid":38525898,"votesmart_id":83989,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":568844,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Bohacek","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":363258,"subject_name":"PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES"},{"subject_id":362779,"subject_name":"COUNTY GOVERNMENT"},{"subject_id":362803,"subject_name":"HEALTH, Local Boards and Programs"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2625859,"date":"2023-01-09","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0081\/id\/2625859","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/81\/#1.INTR","text_size":117193,"text_hash":"cce0337421a35107c1a8ec0bd956e25c"},{"doc_id":2670084,"date":"2023-01-30","type":"Amended","type_id":3,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/SB0081\/id\/2670084","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/senate\/81\/#2.COMS","text_size":136168,"text_hash":"164edf2516927d237fb64cc963778506"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-26","time":"10:00","location":"Room 233","description":"Senate Local Government Hearing"}]}}
