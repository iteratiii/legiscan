Defines \"low water crossing\" as a place where a road crosses a stream having a water level that is normally well below the level of the road but may in times of heavy rain rise above the level of the road to a depth that is difficult for the driver of an oncoming automobile to judge, creating the risk that the driver will attempt to cross at the crossing and the driver's automobile will become buoyant and be swept off the road. Defines \"low water crossing project\" as a project that consists of installing appropriate road signs to warn automobile drivers as they approach a low water crossing, replacing damaged or undersized road culverts in a low water crossing with culverts that will accommodate a greater quantity of stream flow under the road, or replacing a low water crossing with a bridge. Authorizes a local county road and bridge board to undertake low water crossing projects. Requires the commissioner of the department of transportation (department) to ensure that the department makes information available to county boards of commissioners and county highway departments about funding from federal and private sources that might be available to the counties for low water crossing projects. Amends the law concerning the local road and bridge matching grant fund to allow grants from that fund to counties to be used for low water crossing projects.","pending_committee_id":1299,"committee":{"committee_id":1299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":1299,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Authored by Representative Patterson","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Natural Resources","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23976,"person_hash":"35fuu0sl","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Lindsay Patterson","first_name":"Lindsay","middle_name":"","last_name":"Patterson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-055","ftm_eid":54902852,"votesmart_id":120382,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"Lindsay_Patterson","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[],"texts":[{"doc_id":2642411,"date":"2023-01-17","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1497\/id\/2642411","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1497\/#1.INTR","text_size":120358,"text_hash":"e1e80e3ea0f2e47e40d2d54563615dad"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
