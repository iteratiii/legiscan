Provides that an agency of the state or a political subdivision may not provide an individual with an application for an absentee ballot unless requested by the individual or a member of the individual's family. Provides that an absentee ballot application must request that the applicant include: (1) certain identification numbers; or (2) a photocopy of: (A) the applicant's Indiana driver's license, (B) the applicant's Indiana identification card number for nondrivers, or (C) other specified proof of identification. Provides that the application form must state that an applicant may include only one of the identification numbers or one of the documents, but the application may be delayed if the county election board cannot match at least one of the numbers with the voter's registration record. Allows an individual to provide, for purposes of accessing an absentee ballot application submitted in an electronic format: (1) the individual's Indiana identification card number for nondrivers; or (2) the unique identifying number assigned to the voter's registration record in the computerized list; as an alternative to the options available under current law. (Current law requires the provision of the individual's Indiana driver's license number or the last four digits of the individual's Social Security number.) Specifies that certain information and documentation: (1) included on or with an individual's absentee ballot application; or (2) provided to access the ballot application; is confidential. Requires a county election board to implement certain procedures if the county election board cannot match at least one of the numbers with the voter's registration record. Requires the bureau of motor vehicles to provide driver's license numbers and identification card numbers to the secretary of state for the purpose of matching these numbers to voter registration records in the statewide voter registration system. Requires a circuit court clerk or director of a board of elections and registration (clerk) to transmit certain information to an applicant who submits an application to receive an absentee ballot by mail if the application does not fully comply with particular laws. Allows a clerk to: (1) deliver an absentee ballot application in person to a voter who submits a defective application; and (2) receive the corrected ballot from the voter in person before the deadline for receipt of absentee ballots. Requires uniform application if a clerk uses this provision. Makes conforming changes.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":1289,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Elections and
