Provides that a court may not order a person convicted of a: (1) Level 1 felony; or (2) crime subject to certain enhancements; to a community corrections program. Allows a court to place a person in a community corrections program as an alternative to commitment to the county jail or department of correction. Repeals a requirement that a court suspend the sentence for a person placed in a community corrections program. Specifies that a person sentenced to work release in a community corrections program receives one day of accrued time for each day the person is confined on work release. (Current law only specifies that a person on home detention earns accrued time.) Provides that the violation of a home detention placement term constitutes the crime of escape under certain circumstances.
