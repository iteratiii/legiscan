Provides that it is the continuing policy of the state that decisions concerning Indiana's electric generation resource mix, energy infrastructure, and electric service ratemaking constructs must take into account the following attributes of electric utility service: (1) Reliability. (2) Affordability. (3) Resiliency. (4) Stability. (5) Environmental sustainability. Requires the Indiana utility regulatory commission (IURC) to take each of these attributes into account when: (1) reviewing, and preparing a final director's report for, an integrated resource plan submitted by an electric utility; (2) acting upon a petition for the construction, purchase, or lease of an electric generation facility; and (3) reviewing whether the public convenience and necessity continues to require the completion of an electric generation facility under construction. Requires the IURC to commence before September 1, 2023, a comprehensive study to consider the appropriate: (1) design and framework for; and (2) requirements with respect to; performance based ratemaking for investor-owned electricity suppliers. Sets forth certain topics that the IURC shall consider and evaluate in conducting the required study. Requires the IURC to include in its annual report that is due before October 1, 2025, a report containing the IURC's findings and recommendations on the specified topics. Provides that the report must contain recommendations, supported by sufficient data and findings from the IURC's study, with respect to the appropriate: (1) design and framework for; and (2) requirements with respect to; performance based ratemaking for electricity suppliers, so as to enable the general assembly to fully evaluate the impact of performance based ratemaking on all classes of ratepayers, while considering the five attributes of electric utility service set forth as state policy in the bill. Amends the statute governing reliability adequacy metrics for certain electric utilities (\"public utilities\" under the statute) as follows: (1) Defines the terms: (A) \"fall unforced capacity\", or \"fall UCAP\"; and (B) \"spring unforced capacity\", or \"spring UCAP\"; for purposes of the prescribed reliability adequacy metrics. (2) Reduces to 15% the 30% limit (under current law) for a public utility's summer or winter unforced capacity (UCAP) that the public utility is authorized to acquire from capacity markets, for purposes of the reliability adequacy metrics included in a resource planning report (report) submitted to the IURC after June 30, 2023. (3) Provides that the reliability metrics included in a report submitted to the IURC after June 30, 2026, must include specified information concerning a public utility's ability to meet its spring UCAP and fall UCAP. (4) Provides that if, after reviewing a public utility's report, the IURC is not satisfied that the public utility can: (A) provide reliable electric service to its Indiana customers; or (B) either: (i) satisfy both its planning reserve margin requirement or other federal reliability requirements and the reliability adequacy metrics set forth in the bill; or (ii) provide sufficient reason as to why it is unable to satisfy both its planning reserve margin requirement or other federal reliability requirements and the reliability adequacy metrics set forth in the bill; the IURC may conduct an investigation into the matter. (Current law does not require the IURC to consider whether the public utility can provide sufficient reason as to its inability to satisfy both its planning reserve margin requirement or other federal reliability requirements and the reliability adequacy metrics set forth in the bill.) (5) Requires the IURC to include in its 2025 annual report its analysis regarding the appropriate percentage or portion of: (A) total spring UCAP; and (B) total fall UCAP; that public utilities should be authorized to acquire from capacity markets.","pending_committee_id":2722,"committee":{"committee_id":2722,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Utilities"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":3141,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Utilities,
