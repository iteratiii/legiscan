Requires that the county auditor's notice of tax sale include a statement providing that if a tract or item of real property has been offered for sale at a county treasurer's tax sale (treasurer's sale) and a county executive's tax sale (executive's sale) on two or more occasions without a bid, the tract or item of real property may be subject to an ordinance authorized by the bill. Adds a person who claims a substantial property interest of public record to a statute concerning the county auditor's provision of notice of tax sale to certain persons who annually request a copy of the notice. Provides that a person who owns any tract or item of real property that has been offered for sale at a treasurer's sale and executive's sale on two or more occasions without a bid is prohibited from bidding on or purchasing tracts offered for sale. Adds language that allows a county legislative body to adopt an ordinance with respect to parcels of real property that have been offered for sale at a treasurer's sale and an executive's sale on two or more occasions without a bid. Specifies that such a parcel (subject to certain criteria) is considered a public hazard. Establishes a procedure for a county to transfer a tax sale certificate to a municipality or retain a tax sale certificate and for a county or municipality to file a petition with the circuit court (court) requesting the issuance of a deed for the property to the requesting county or municipality. Provides that, at the request of a municipality, the county auditor and county treasurer (subject to available funding) shall enter into a mutual agreement for the county auditor to perform certain duties concerning notification of a party's right to redeem such a parcel and the filing of a petition to the court for issuance of a tax deed for the parcel. Provides that the court shall hold a hearing on the petition for issuance of a tax deed. Provides requirements that apply to a quiet title action with respect to a parcel placed into the name of a county or municipality. Provides that an owner of a parcel of real property that has been offered for sale at a treasurer's sale and an executive's sale on two or more occasions without a bid may transfer the real property, subject to any liens and encumbrances, by warranty deed to a county or municipality.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":1327,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":38,"name":"Local
