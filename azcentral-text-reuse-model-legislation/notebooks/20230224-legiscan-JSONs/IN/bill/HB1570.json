Provides that: (1) a foster parent is immune from civil and criminal liability for releasing or disclosing confidential information to a duly elected state government official for whom the information is relevant to the official's responsibility under the law to protect children from child abuse and neglect (elected official); (2) a confidentiality agreement entered into between a foster parent and the department of child services (department) may not prohibit the foster parent from releasing or disclosing information to an elected official; and (3) an individual's release or disclosure of information to an elected official is not a breach of the individual's duty under any agreement entered into by the individual in connection with the individual's role as a foster parent. Provides that the department may not: (1) take adverse action against a foster parent's license; or (2) remove a foster child from the home of a foster parent; solely on the basis of the foster parent having spoken to an elected official.

Provides that the department may not remove a foster child from the home of a foster parent, unlicensed caregiver, or de facto custodian solely on the basis of the foster parent, unlicensed caregiver, or de facto custodian having filed a petition to adopt the child. Allows a child's adoptive parent to request that the department allow the child visitation with the child's sibling.
