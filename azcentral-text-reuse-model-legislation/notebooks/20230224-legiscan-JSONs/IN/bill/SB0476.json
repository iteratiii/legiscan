Provides that after June 30, 2023, a payment card network may not provide to a vendor with whom the holder of a payment card (cardholder) has an automatic payment arrangement the new: (1) payment card number; (2) expiration date; or (3) card verification value code; for a replacement card that is issued to the cardholder after the cardholder's payment card has been lost, stolen, or compromised, unless the payment card network obtains the cardholder's authorization to do so. Provides that a payment card network may obtain the required authorization: (1) before each transfer of new payment card information that is necessitated by a lost, stolen, or compromised payment card; or (2) at the option of the cardholder, as a preauthorization given in advance of any required transfer of new payment card information necessitated by a lost, stolen, or compromised payment card.
