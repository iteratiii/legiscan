Requires: (1) a regional sewage district; or (2) certain municipalities; at least 90 days before requiring the connection of a property to a sewer system and the discontinuance of use of the property's septic system, to notify the property's owner about a statutory exemption from the requirement to connect to the sewer system that may apply to the property. As of January 1, 2023, transfers authority over 410 IAC 6-8.3, an administrative rule on residential onsite sewage systems, from the Indiana department of health to the technical review panel.

and (2) other new and technically advanced residential onsite sewage systems and technology that will potentially provide effective and sanitary solutions to residential sewage treatment and disposal problems.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":1290,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Environmental Affairs"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Authored by Representative Pressel","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Environmental Affairs","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Committee report: amend do pass, adopted","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Representative Miller D added as coauthor","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Second reading: ordered engrossed","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Senate sponsors: Senators Niemeyer and Perfect","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Third reading: passed;
