Requires a court to assess a safe schools fee (fee) of at least $200 and not more than $1,000 when a person operates a vehicle and recklessly passes a school bus stopped on a roadway or a private road when the arm signal device is in the device's extended position (violation). (Current law permits, rather than requires, a court to assess the fee.) Provides that: (1) the clerk of a circuit court; or (2) the clerk of a city or town court; shall distribute semiannually 100% of the fee collected to the school corporation of the school bus that is the subject of a violation to reimburse the school corporation an amount sufficient to defray the cost of school bus cameras.","pending_committee_id":1287,"committee":{"committee_id":1287,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Courts and Criminal Code"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":1287,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"name":"Courts and Criminal Code"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Authored by Representative Genda","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"First reading: referred to Committee on Courts and Criminal Code","chamber":"H","chamber_id":37,"importance":1}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":24486,"person_hash":"yhaej8zq","party_id":"2","state_id":14,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mark Genda","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Genda","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-041","ftm_eid":54902813,"votesmart_id":201968,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":0,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Genda","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[],"texts":[{"doc_id":2653387,"date":"2023-01-19","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/IN\/text\/HB1538\/id\/2653387","state_link":"https:\/\/iga.in.gov\/legislative\/2023\/bills\/house\/1538\/#1.INTR","text_size":172059,"text_hash":"2e123c216da867ff45ee4be6d716671b"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
