Establishes the Public School Trades Incentive Fund (the Fund) and the Public School Trades Incentive Program (the Program) for the purpose of providing grants on a competitive basis from the Fund to any school board that seeks to (i) restore high school programs that teach students skilled trades that lead to earning industry-recognized certifications or credentials or (ii) create or restore middle school programs that encourage and recruit students to participate in high school programs that teach students skilled trades that lead to earning industry-recognized certifications or credentials. The bill requires the Department of Education to administer the Program and to establish such rules and procedures relating to applications and awards as it deems appropriate, provided that the Department considers and gives appropriate weight to certain criteria for grantees. The bill permits any grantee to use Program funds for equipment, curriculum development, or instructor training. The bill requires each grantee to longitudinally track students who complete any program for which the school board received funds in order to determine the effectiveness of the (a) new or restored middle school programs in recruiting students to participate in restored high school programs and (b) restored high school programs in matching students with high-paying jobs in the fields in which they are certified or credentialed.","pending_committee_id":164,"committee":{"committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-14","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2022-02-01","committee_id":3890,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Health"},{"date":"2022-02-03","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-14","action":"Presented and ordered printed 22102570D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-14","action":"Referred to Committee on Education and Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-02-01","action":"Assigned Education sub:","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-03","action":"Reported from Education and Health with amendment (15-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-02-03","action":"Rereferred to Finance and Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-09","action":"Continued to 2023 in Finance and Appropriations (11-Y 5-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-21","action":"Left in Finance and Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11333,"person_hash":"b1nscxlr","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"William Stanley","first_name":"William","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Stanley","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-020","ftm_eid":6699795,"votesmart_id":128559,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":329637,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Stanley","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":9,"type":"Carry Over","sast_bill_number":"SB628","sast_bill_id":1559849}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":213,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":169302,"subject_name":"Public Schools"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2609659,"date":"2022-01-14","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB628\/id\/2609659","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB628+hil","text_size":4436,"text_hash":"f7e570be2047500c18db55120caf7ecb"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1228802,"date":"2022-02-03","desc":"Senate: Reported from Education and Health with amendment (15-Y 0-N)","yea":15,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB628\/id\/1228802","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S04C0114+SB0628"},{"roll_call_id":1228803,"date":"2022-02-09","desc":"Senate: Continued to 2023 in Finance and Appropriations (11-Y 5-N)","yea":11,"nay":5,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":16,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB628\/id\/1228803","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S05C0182+SB0628"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":150493,"adopted":0,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"date":"2022-06-20","title":"Senate amendments","description":"Senate amendments","mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/SB628\/id\/150493","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+amd+SB628AS","amendment_size":1661,"amendment_hash":"c8366bd940cd00c7805b8c884a36dba3"}],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":286162,"date":"2022-06-20","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Presented and ordered printed 22102570D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB628\/id\/286162","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB628F122+PDF","supplement_size":95518,"supplement_hash":"c73632b6782b02eb6820c18b6564da78"}],"calendar":[]}}
