Requires that the written explanation the court files with the record of a case when departing from the sentencing guidelines adequately explains the sentence imposed to promote fair sentencing. The bill provides that the failure to follow any of the required sentencing provisions, including the failure to provide a written explanation that adequately explains the sentence imposed, shall be reviewable on appeal or may be the basis of any other post-conviction relief. The bill also provides that the failure to provide a written explanation that adequately explains the sentence imposed is an error that may constitute a basis for resentencing by the trial judge. Under current law, the failure to follow any or all of the provisions of the sentencing guidelines or the failure to follow any or all of such provisions in the prescribed manner is not reviewable on appeal and cannot be the basis of any other post-conviction relief. The provisions of the bill apply only to those sentencing hearings conducted and such sentences imposed on or after July 1, 2023.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-06","committee_id":4165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2023-02-09","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-02-11","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-22","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
