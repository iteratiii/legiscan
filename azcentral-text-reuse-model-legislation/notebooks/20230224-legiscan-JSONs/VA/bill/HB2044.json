Gives a court discretion in determining the appropriate amount, if any, of fines and fees imposed against a juvenile for a traffic infraction or other traffic offense and eliminates the court's authority to impose a fine as an order of disposition for a juvenile delinquency. The bill also provides that after a juvenile is adjudicated to be delinquent but prior to the imposition of any penalty, the court shall determine the applicable fees and costs, including attorney fees, to be assessed against the juvenile's parents and shall determine if such juvenile's parents are financially able to pay for the attorney in whole or in part and refuse to do so. The bill provides that while determining if any fees or costs should be imposed, the court shall give the juvenile, or the juvenile's attorney, and the parents an opportunity to be heard. Finally, the bill requires the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia to annually report to the Governor and General Assembly on the total fines and costs assessed in the preceding calendar year in all criminal and traffic cases for each circuit court participating in the Office of the Executive Secretary's case management system and for each general district court and juvenile and domestic relations district court. The bill requires that the report include the fines and costs assessed by race of the defendant. The bill contains technical amendments.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-01-24","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103663D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Assigned Courts sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-27","action":"Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23037,"person_hash":"3ekh3jhb","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Irene Shin","first_name":"Irene","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-086","ftm_eid":53400349,"votesmart_id":196026,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773087,"ballotpedia":"Irene_Shin","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":204,"subject_name":"Courts Not of Record"},{"subject_id":21075,"subject_name":"Fines and Costs"},{"subject_id":169164,"subject_name":"Study Commissions Committees and Reports"},{"subject_id":175738,"subject_name":"Juveniles"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2633956,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB2044\/id\/2633956","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB2044+hil","text_size":142009,"text_hash":"442be55172224da5d6500f1f787de30b"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1237129,"date":"2023-01-27","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","yea":5,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB2044\/id\/1237129","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0801V0175+HB2044"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":153039,"adopted":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"date":"2023-01-27","title":"Substitute for HB2044 Courts of Justice, Subcommittee #1","description":"Substitute for HB2044 Courts of Justice, Subcommittee #1","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/HB2044\/id\/153039","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23105422D.pdf","amendment_size":194885,"amendment_hash":"d8caea7b77fcd9b115108813bcaf65b5"}],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-25","time":"00:00","location":"House Room 3","description":"House Courts of Justice - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-27","time":"00:00","location":"House Room 3","description":"House Courts of Justice - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
