Provides that a governing body of a locality may increase the real property tax rate (i) by an amount lower than three percent through a public hearing and a majority vote of the governing body; (ii) by an amount of three percent or more, but lower than five percent through a public hearing and a two-thirds majority vote of the governing body; and (iii) by an amount of five percent or more through holding a referendum. The bill provides that the governing body of a locality may not hold a public hearing for a proposed rate increase on the same day as the annual budget hearing. Under current law, the governing body of a locality is required to limit the real property tax rate to a rate that would collect no more than 101 percent of the amount of real property taxes collected for the previous year; increases above this rate may only be imposed if the locality holds a public hearing.","pending_committee_id":152,"committee":{"committee_id":152,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":152,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance"},{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":3868,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":152,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23104015D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Referred to Committee on Finance","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Assigned Finance sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Finance","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21449,"person_hash":"b6zdfzvz","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Wendell Walker","first_name":"Wendell","middle_name":"Scott","last_name":"Walker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-023","ftm_eid":35530499,"votesmart_id":186415,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":453824,"ballotpedia":"Wendell_Walker","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":289,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":169168,"subject_name":"Counties Cities and Towns"},{"subject_id":354145,"subject_name":"Real Property"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2629894,"date":"2023-01-09","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1749\/id\/2629894","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1749+hil","text_size":8428,"text_hash":"6ab0bf6ce8cea377dfca8fa937a9958c"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":293520,"date":"2023-01-21","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23104015D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1749\/id\/293520","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1749F161+PDF","supplement_size":135963,"supplement_hash":"1a0ad7cfb3006da6387f7451448c5093"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-24","time":"16:00","location":"House Room 1","description":"House Finance - Subcommittee #2 Committee Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-31","time":"16:00","location":"House Room 1","description":"House Finance - Subcommittee #2 Committee Hearing"}]}}
