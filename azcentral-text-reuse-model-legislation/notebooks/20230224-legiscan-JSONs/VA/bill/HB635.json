Requires cities and towns in the Commonwealth to develop and promulgate housing plans that address the supply of safe, sanitary, and affordable shelter for all current and anticipated residents of their communities. Such plans must connect economic development efforts that bring new jobs to the supply of safe, sanitary, and affordable shelter for all who will fill those jobs; the location of housing and the location of mobility resources; and the availability of accredited high-quality affordable education, parks, indoor and outdoor recreation, libraries, health care, and healthy living resources, including the availability of fresh food. Such housing plans shall be reviewed and revised no less frequently than every five years. Cities and towns that promulgate a housing plan may create, implement, and enforce inclusionary housing programs applicable to new housing development and conversions of previously nonresidential uses into residential uses. Counties utilizing the urban county executive form of government (Fairfax County) or the county manager plan of government (Arlington County) may also follow and use these provisions to provide inclusionary housing.","pending_committee_id":149,"committee":{"committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-11","committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"},{"date":"2022-01-24","committee_id":3856,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2022-02-11","committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22101004D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-01-24","action":"Assigned CC & T sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-11","action":"Continued to 2023 in Counties, Cities and Towns by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-22","action":"Left in Counties, Cities and Towns","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":1478,"person_hash":"cnprvkye","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Betsy Carr","first_name":"Betsy","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Carr","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-069","ftm_eid":6065415,"votesmart_id":111181,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":283103,"ballotpedia":"Betsy_Carr","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":1465,"person_hash":"ykqcehjx","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Delores McQuinn","first_name":"Delores","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"McQuinn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-070","ftm_eid":6498305,"votesmart_id":79252,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":276165,"ballotpedia":"Delores_McQuinn","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":9,"type":"Carry Over","sast_bill_number":"HB635","sast_bill_id":1551528}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":237,"subject_name":"Housing"},{"subject_id":169168,"subject_name":"Counties Cities and Towns"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2609631,"date":"2022-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB635\/id\/2609631","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB635+hil","text_size":7403,"text_hash":"db6aacf4b1aeb0bf829f1e14cecc4703"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":286144,"date":"2022-06-20","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22101004D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB635\/id\/286144","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB635F164+PDF","supplement_size":83771,"supplement_hash":"3c63dd768d7dd9e9484b68bc2852f675"}],"calendar":[]}}
