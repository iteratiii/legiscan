Provides that when severe weather conditions or other emergency situations have resulted in the closing of any school in a school division for in-person instruction, the school division shall declare an unscheduled remote learning day whereby the school provides instruction and student services that are consistent with guidelines established by the Department of Education to ensure the equitable provision of such services, provided, however, that no school division claims more than 10 unscheduled remote learning days in a school year unless the Superintendent of Public Instruction grants an extension. Under current law, such unscheduled remote learning days are permissive rather than mandatory.","pending_committee_id":151,"committee":{"committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-01-24","committee_id":4572,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education: Early Childhood\/Innovation"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102643D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Referred to Committee on Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Assigned Education sub: Early Childhood\/Innovation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Subcommittee recommends striking from docket (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":713,"person_hash":"d4y3pqr7","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Daniel Marshall","first_name":"Daniel","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Marshall","suffix":"III","nickname":"Danny","district":"HD-014","ftm_eid":5941605,"votesmart_id":50841,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":209950,"ballotpedia":"Danny_Marshall_III","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":213,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":169302,"subject_name":"Public Schools"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2626253,"date":"2023-01-09","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1666\/id\/2626253","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1666+hil","text_size":10185,"text_hash":"a77cb2a1cc8dca8810e7ed4daf9fe621"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1235572,"date":"2023-01-25","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends striking from docket (8-Y 0-N)","yea":8,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1666\/id\/1235572","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0903V0019+HB1666"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":291563,"date":"2023-01-17","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102643D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1666\/id\/291563","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1666F122+PDF","supplement_size":57023,"supplement_hash":"8baa593cdf0c648c277bca1241382433"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-25","time":"00:00","location":"House Committee Room","description":"House Education - Early Childhood\/Innovation Subcommittee Hearing"}]}}
