Establishes the Education Savings Account Program, to be administered by the Department of Education, whereby the parent of any individual who is a resident of the Commonwealth and who is eligible to enroll in a public elementary or secondary school may apply for an Education Savings Account for his child into which the Department of Education deposits certain state and local funds and from which the parent makes certain enumerated qualifying expenses to educate his child in a setting and a manner other than full-time education in a public school. The bill requires the Program to be fully implemented prior to the beginning of the 2023\u20132024 school year. The bill also increases the value of the Education Improvement Scholarships income tax credit for a donation to a scholarship foundation from 65 percent to 100 percent of the donation. The bill removes the aggregate limit on tax credits per year, which under current law is $25 million, and removes individual minimum and maximum required donation amounts. The bill raises the threshold for students to qualify for scholarships from 300 percent of the current poverty guidelines to 1,000 percent of free or reduced-price lunch standards or, for eligible students with a disability, from 400 percent of the current poverty guidelines to 1,200 percent of such standards. The bill grants scholarship foundations the discretion to determine what expenses may be funded by tax-credit-subsidized scholarships. Under current law, such expenses are limited by statute. The bill expands eligibility for scholarships to any student who is a resident of the Commonwealth and eligible to enroll in a public elementary or secondary school in the Commonwealth. Current law restricts eligibility to certain categories of students. The bill removes the requirement that scholarship-funded schools report test results of scholarship-funded students. The provisions of the bill pertaining to the Education Improvement Scholarships income tax credits apply starting with taxable year 2023.","pending_committee_id":151,"committee":{"committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-11-30","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-01-23","committee_id":4572,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education: Early Childhood\/Innovation"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-11-30","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100013D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-30","action":"Referred to Committee on Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Assigned Education sub: Early Childhood\/Innovation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23017,"person_hash":"vwv4vvnr","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Marie March","first_name":"Marie","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"March","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-007","ftm_eid":53917614,"votesmart_id":196363,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":783661,"ballotpedia":"Marie_March","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22455,"person_hash":"o9t6i48u","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Bill Wiley","first_name":"Bill","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Wiley","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-029","ftm_eid":50548059,"votesmart_id":195333,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":757468,"ballotpedia":"Bill_Wiley","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":213,"subject_name":"Education"},{"subject_id":289,"subject_name":"Taxation"},{"subject_id":169215,"subject_name":"Scholarships"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2614710,"date":"2022-11-30","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1396\/id\/2614710","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1396+hil","text_size":80192,"text_hash":"e1cc02ff3c4ef25178123111448954dc"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1235940,"date":"2023-01-25","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (8-Y 0-N)","yea":8,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1396\/id\/1235940","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0903V0042+HB1396"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-25","time":"00:00","location":"House Committee Room","description":"House Education - Early Childhood\/Innovation Subcommittee Hearing"}]}}
