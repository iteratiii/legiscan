Requires Community corrections alternative program. Requires defendants to enter into and complete the community corrections alternative program (\"CCAP\") after (i) a recommendation from the Department of Corrections (\"Department\"), (ii) a determination by the court that the defendant will benefit from the community corrections alternative program and is capable of returning to society as a productive citizen following successful completion of the program, and (iii) the defendant would otherwise be committed to the Department. The bill provides that if the defendant is removed from the program for intractable behavior or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall show cause the defendant to show cause why his probation and suspension of sentence should not be revoked.  The bill also directs the Parole Board to require violators to enter into and complete CCAP upon the same above conditions; the Parole Board may revoke parole or mandatory release and recommit the violator upon removal from the program by the Department for intractable behavior or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of parole or mandatory release. Current law allows defendants\/parole violators to be placed on probation conditioned upon entry and successful competition of CCAP and directs the court to require a defendant to show cause why his probation and suspension of sentence should not be revoked on the grounds of his voluntary withdrawal from the program.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101512D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Assigned Courts sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23034,"person_hash":"4r2lyyzs","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nadarius Clark","first_name":"Nadarius","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":53400342,"votesmart_id":196001,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773076,"ballotpedia":"Nadarius_Clark","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22416,"person_hash":"w39hq3xq","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Candi Mundon King","first_name":"Candi","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mundon King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-002","ftm_eid":52701188,"votesmart_id":195689,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":762107,"ballotpedia":"Candi_King","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16093,"person_hash":"ghkk9r3a","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sam Rasoul","first_name":"Sam","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rasoul","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-011","ftm_eid":19875124,"votesmart_id":109345,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":267157,"ballotpedia":"Sam_Rasoul","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":207,"subject_name":"Criminal Procedure"},{"subject_id":169206,"subject_name":"Defendants"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2629162,"date":"2023-01-09","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1718\/id\/2629162","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1718+hil","text_size":10401,"text_hash":"f7dcddecaeb368d0e64cc05d67ace3c0"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1232797,"date":"2023-01-18","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","yea":5,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1718\/id\/1232797","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0801V0093+HB1718"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":151899,"adopted":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"date":"2023-01-18","title":"Substitute for HB1718 Courts of Justice, Subcommittee #1","description":"Substitute for HB1718 Courts of Justice, Subcommittee #1","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/HB1718\/id\/151899","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23104764D.pdf","amendment_size":19503,"amendment_hash":"45c818974b1062498d7eaa8dcfe5615f"}],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-18","time":"00:00","location":"House Room 3","description":"House Courts of Justice - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
