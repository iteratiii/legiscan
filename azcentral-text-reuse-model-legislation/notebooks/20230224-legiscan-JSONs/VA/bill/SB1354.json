Revises the procedure under which a contractor may be debarred from public contracts for misclassification of workers. The bill requires the Tax Department to notify an employer of a determination that the employer failed to properly classify an individual and allows the employer to apply for judicial or administrative review. Upon a subsequent violation, and once the opportunity for appeals has been exhausted, the Department is required to provide notice to all public bodies that they shall not award a contract to firms associated with the offending employer for specified periods. Under current law, notice to all public bodies is required after the first violation determined by the Department, and debarment is required without reference to the timing of appeals.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and
