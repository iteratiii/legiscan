Establishes the College and Career Readiness for English Language Learners Grant Program and Fund to support English language learner students in preparing for postsecondary opportunities by providing reimbursement grants to eligible school divisions for providing and expanding access to certain career, technical, apprenticeship, and college readiness and preparation programs and courses for high school students identified as having limited English proficiency. The bill provides that the total value of reimbursement grants awarded to any school division annually shall not exceed an amount equal to $500 times the number of English language learner students in grades nine through 12 enrolled in such school division. The bill directs the Board to establish such guidelines as it deems necessary for the administration of the Program and to establish procedures for determining amounts and prioritizing the award of such reimbursement grants in the event that the moneys in the Fund are not sufficient to provide each school division the full grant amount for which they are qualified. Finally, the bill provides that reimbursement grants shall be awarded to eligible school divisions beginning with the 2023 - 2024 school year.","pending_committee_id":147,"committee":{"committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":4572,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education: Early Childhood\/Innovation"},{"date":"2023-01-23","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},{"date":"2023-01-24","committee_id":3849,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations: Elementary & Secondary Education"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102776D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Assigned Education sub: Early Childhood\/Innovation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Subcommittee recommends reporting (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Subcommittee recommends referring to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Reported from Education (18-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Referred to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Assigned App. sub: Elementary & Secondary Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21412,"person_hash":"p44fto4a","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Avoli","first_name":"G.","middle_name":"","last_name":"Avoli","suffix":"","nickname":"John","district":"HD-020","ftm_eid":47299313,"votesmart_id":186412,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":702481,"ballotpedia":"John_Avoli","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19440,"person_hash":"yl6g82ws","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Guzman","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Guzman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-031","ftm_eid":43620466,"votesmart_id":176356,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620436,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Guzman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23034,"person_hash":"4r2lyyzs","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nadarius Clark","first_name":"Nadarius","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":53400342,"votesmart_id":196001,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773076,"ballotpedia":"Nadarius_Clark","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
