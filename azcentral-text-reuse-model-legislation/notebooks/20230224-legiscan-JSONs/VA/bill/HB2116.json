Prohibits employers from (i) using a credit report in connection with or as a criterion for employment purposes, (ii) requesting or procuring a credit report for employment purposes, or (iii) requiring an employee or prospective employee to answer a question about the contents of a credit report or the information contained therein. Notwithstanding this prohibition, the bill lists conditions under which an employer or person acting on behalf of an employer may obtain, use, or seek a credit report from an employee or prospective employee. The bill prohibits any waiver of its requirements and prohibits retaliation and other discrimination or adverse action taken by an employer against an employee for alleging a violation of its requirements. The bill provides that the State Corporation Commission shall enforce the requirements of the bill by imposing civil penalties, notifying employers, and conducting informal conferences to assess violations.","pending_committee_id":4570,"committee":{"committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},{"date":"2023-01-24","committee_id":4579,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103020D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Assigned sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21453,"person_hash":"9jmp5nl2","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sally Hudson","first_name":"Sally","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Hudson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-057","ftm_eid":47299294,"votesmart_id":186397,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":702494,"ballotpedia":"Sally_Hudson","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":22993,"person_hash":"oe3rh8o2","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Timothy Anderson","first_name":"Timothy","middle_name":"V.","last_name":"Anderson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-083","ftm_eid":53400425,"votesmart_id":196004,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773187,"ballotpedia":"Tim_Anderson","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
