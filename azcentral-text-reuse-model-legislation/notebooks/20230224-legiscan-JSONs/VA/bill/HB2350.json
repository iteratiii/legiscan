Requires any person who possesses a firearm in a residence where such person knows or reasonably should know that a minor under 18 years of age is present to store such firearm unloaded in a locked container, compartment, or cabinet and to store all ammunition in a separate locked container, compartment, or cabinet. The bill requires that the key or combination to such locked containers, compartments, or cabinets be inaccessible to any minor. The bill provides that a violation is a Class 1 misdemeanor, and, in a case where there is more than one firearm stored in violation of these provisions, a violation for each firearm shall constitute a separate Class 1 misdemeanor. The bill exempts any person in lawful possession of a firearm who carries such firearm on or about his person, the storage of antique firearms, and the lawful authorization of a minor to access a firearm.","pending_committee_id":4177,"committee":{"committee_id":4177,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Public
