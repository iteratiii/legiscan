Authorizes a health insurance carrier to issue short-term limited-duration medical plans with an expiration date that is less than 12 months after the original effective date of the contract, policy, or plan and, taking into account renewals or extensions, that has a duration that is no longer than 36 months. Under current law, a carrier is prohibited from selling a short-term limited-duration medical plan that exceeds three months or that can be renewed or extended beyond six months. The bill provides that, notwithstanding any of the provisions of the bill, a carrier may issue any short-term limited-duration health plan that meets the definition of \"short-term limited-duration insurance\" provided in federal law. Finally, the bill sets out a disclaimer notice to be included on any short-term limited-duration medical plan sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
