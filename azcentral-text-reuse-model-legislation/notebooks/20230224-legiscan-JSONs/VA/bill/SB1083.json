The bill provides that a customer's net bill for participation in the shared solar program shall not exceed the minimum bill that the State Corporation Commission is required to establish, provides considerations for the Commission in establishing such minimum bill, such as minimizing the costs shifted to non-participating customers, and provides that the calculation of a customer's minimum bill shall be based on the percentage of shared solar capacity attributable to each of the subscribers in accordance with the subscriber's portion of the output of the shared solar facility. The bill provides that the Commission shall approve a shared solar program of 150 megawatts with a minimum requirement of 30 percent low income customers and that an additional 50 megawatts shall be approved by the Commission upon determining that at least 45 megawatts of the aggregated shared solar capacity in the Commonwealth are subscribed to by low-income customers. The bill requires the Commission's regulations for the shared solar program to allow all jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional customer classes to participate in the program. The bill also directs the Department of Energy to convene a stakeholder workgroup to evaluate incentives for certain shared solar projects and submit a report of its recommendations by November 30, 2023.
