Provides that it is the policy of the Commonwealth to promote the development and operation of small modular nuclear reactors at the earliest reasonable time possible, with a goal of having the first small modular nuclear reactor operating by the end of 2032, and requires the State Corporation Commission to establish a small modular nuclear reactor pilot program. Under the program, any entity that holds a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct or operate one or more existing nuclear facilities at the time of the application may apply to the State Corporation Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to complete site permitting and construct and operate one or more small modular nuclear reactors. Under the bill, the pilot program will be limited to three small modular nuclear reactor sites in the Commonwealth. The bill requires the State Corporation Commission to consider certain factors in considering an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a small modular nuclear reactor under the pilot program.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and
