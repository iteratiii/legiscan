Provides that the local governing body of a locality may adopt an ordinance that requires the inspection and certification of a residential rental dwelling unit built prior to 1986 for the purpose of ensuring the absence of lead hazards in such dwelling unit. The bill requires any such inspection and certification to be completed by a person licensed and qualified pursuant to appropriate state and federal laws and regulations and prohibits the rental of any residential dwelling unit that does not receive a satisfactory post-inspection certification based on certain factors outlined in the bill. Pursuant to the provisions of the bill, any locality that adopts an ordinance shall establish a fund to pay for the cost of remediation or require the landlord to pay for remedying the lead hazard. Finally, the bill allows a locality to waive inspection requirements for certain reasons and permits the local governing body of a locality to adopt additional lead-safe and lead-free inspection and certification requirements or higher standards for inspection and certification, if it so chooses.","pending_committee_id":165,"committee":{"committee_id":165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"General Laws and Technology"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-11","committee_id":165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"General Laws and Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22100977D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on General Laws and Technology","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-02-09","action":"Continued to 2023 in General Laws and Technology (12-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-21","action":"Left in General Laws and Technology","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":725,"person_hash":"2bf9yjmv","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Joseph Morrissey","first_name":"Joseph","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Morrissey","suffix":"","nickname":"Joe","district":"SD-016","ftm_eid":5991272,"votesmart_id":69982,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":260432,"ballotpedia":"Joseph_Morrissey","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":9,"type":"Carry Over","sast_bill_number":"SB410","sast_bill_id":1557728}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":237,"subject_name":"Housing"},{"subject_id":175453,"subject_name":"Building Code"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2609654,"date":"2022-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB410\/id\/2609654","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB410+hil","text_size":5657,"text_hash":"44f8ef772a05d44e17610aaa6d49d722"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1228798,"date":"2022-02-09","desc":"Senate: Continued to 2023 in General Laws and Technology (12-Y 0-N)","yea":12,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":12,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB410\/id\/1228798","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S12C0083+SB0410"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":286158,"date":"2022-06-21","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22100977D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB410\/id\/286158","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB410F122+PDF","supplement_size":68609,"supplement_hash":"0d521031a136db1f3459ac3bf45ea0b3"}],"calendar":[]}}
