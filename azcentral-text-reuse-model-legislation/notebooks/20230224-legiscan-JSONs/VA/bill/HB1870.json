Removes the exemption of the Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors from the requirement to include in its policy, code, rules, or set of standards governing sexual violence a provision for immunity from disciplinary action for certain individuals who make good faith reports of acts of sexual violence but permits Virginia Military Institute to include a provision stipulating that in the event that a cadet discloses personal consumption of drugs or alcohol in conjunction with a good faith report of an act of sexual violence and the superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute determines that such cadet's personal consumption of drugs or alcohol constitutes a threat to the cadet's well-being or the well-being of others, the superintendent may require such cadet to attend drug or substance use disorder counseling. The bill also requires the governing board of each public and nonprofit private institution of higher education to extend such provision of disciplinary immunity to disclosures of curfew violation where such disclosure is made in conjunction with a good faith report of an act of sexual violence.
