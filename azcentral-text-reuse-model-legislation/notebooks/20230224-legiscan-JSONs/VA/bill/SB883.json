Eliminates the requirement that the Board of Education perform a triennial review of the accreditation status of a public school that has been fully accredited for three consecutive years. The bill also eliminates the provision permitting the Board to do a review of the accreditation status of any other school once every two or three years and the requirement that any such school receiving a multiyear accreditation status other than full accreditation be covered by a Board-approved multiyear corrective action plan. Under the bill, the Board is required to review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-04","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and
