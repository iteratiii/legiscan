Provides that if a petitioner files a written motion requesting a hearing to extend a permanent protective order, the court may issue an ex parte protective order until the extension hearing, which shall be held within 15 days of the issuance of such ex parte protective order and may be held after the expiration of the permanent protective order. If the respondent fails to appear at the extension hearing because the respondent was not personally served with such motion, a new date for the extension hearing shall be given and the judge may extend the ex parte preliminary protective order until the new date. The bill also provides that if the respondent was personally served, where the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that a continuance is necessary to meet the ends of justice or the respondent shows good cause, the court may continue the extension hearing and such ex parte preliminary protective order shall remain in effect until the extension hearing.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of
