Provides a rebuttable presumption of a landlord's material noncompliance with the rental agreement if the leased premises was condemned by an appropriate state or local agency due to the landlord's or his agent's refusal or failure to remedy a condition for which he was served a condemnation notice, unless such condition was caused by an act of God. The bill requires a court, when such rebuttable presumption is established, to award the tenant the amount of three months' rent, any prepaid rent, and any security deposit paid by the tenant.","pending_committee_id":153,"committee":{"committee_id":153,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":153,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws"},{"date":"2023-01-18","committee_id":3871,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":153,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103116D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on General Laws","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Assigned GL sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 5-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in General Laws","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":13732,"person_hash":"viwu2oei","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Alfonso Lopez","first_name":"Alfonso","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Lopez","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-049","ftm_eid":6513498,"votesmart_id":134512,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":362043,"ballotpedia":"Alfonso_Lopez","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23033,"person_hash":"r5m6j4id","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Bennett-Parker","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Bennett-Parker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-045","ftm_eid":43746485,"votesmart_id":195975,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":772968,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Bennett-Parker","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23034,"person_hash":"4r2lyyzs","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nadarius Clark","first_name":"Nadarius","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":53400342,"votesmart_id":196001,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773076,"ballotpedia":"Nadarius_Clark","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23040,"person_hash":"bekkq5bg","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jackie Glass","first_name":"Jackie","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Glass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-089","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":201393,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":795351,"ballotpedia":"Jackie_Glass_(Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19440,"person_hash":"yl6g82ws","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Guzman","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Guzman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-031","ftm_eid":43620466,"votesmart_id":176356,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620436,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Guzman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
