Certain public elementary schools; parent liaison position. Requires a local school board to employ, in any public elementary or secondary school in which at least 20 percent of enrolled students are identified as members of a single racial or ethnic group that constitutes a minority of the total population of the United States, at least one full-time parent liaison who is also a member of such racial or ethnic group per the first 200 students who are identified as members of such group and at least one such additional full-time parent liaison per each additional 300 students who are identified as members of such group beyond the first 200 such students. The bill requires each such parent liaison to serve as a liaison between the guardians of such students and the school principal and staff and to provide guardians, particularly of minority students, with a variety of information about school programs, requirements, resources, events, and activities and perform related work as required. The bill requires these positions to be included in the Standards of Quality and funded by the Commonwealth at a rate equivalent to the school division's prevailing average secondary teacher cost and provides that these positions shall not be considered support services positions. The bill also provides that the General Assembly recognizes the necessity for and encourages each school board to employ parent liaisons in schools in the local school division with impacted attendance rates and lower enrollment rates because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","pending_committee_id":151,"committee":{"committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-01-23","committee_id":4571,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education: K-12"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101046D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Assigned Education sub: K-12","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 5-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":19440,"person_hash":"yl6g82ws","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Guzman","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Guzman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-031","ftm_eid":43620466,"votesmart_id":176356,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620436,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Guzman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23034,"person_hash":"4r2lyyzs","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nadarius Clark","first_name":"Nadarius","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":53400342,"votesmart_id":196001,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773076,"ballotpedia":"Nadarius_Clark","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
