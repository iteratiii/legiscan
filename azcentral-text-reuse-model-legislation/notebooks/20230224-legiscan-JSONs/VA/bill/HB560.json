Requires a carrier to administer its health benefit plans in a manner consistent with certain requirements and to include such requirements in its provider contracts addressing the provision of pharmacy benefits management. The bill provides that (i) a covered individual is permitted to fill any mail order-covered prescription, at the covered individual's option, at any mail order pharmacy or network participating retail community pharmacy under certain conditions; (ii) the carrier or pharmacy benefits manager is prohibited from imposing a differential copayment, additional fee, rebate, bonus, or other condition on any covered individual who elects to fill his prescription at an in-network retail community pharmacy that is not similarly imposed on covered individuals electing to fill a prescription from a mail order pharmacy; and (iii) the pharmacy benefits manager is required to expressly disclose to the carrier in the contract if the pharmacy benefits manager retains all or a greater portion of a drug manufacturer's rebate amount or any additional direct or indirect remuneration from any third party for drugs dispensed through the pharmacy benefits manager-owned mail order pharmacy than the pharmacy benefits manager does for drugs dispensed through a retail community pharmacy. The bill also removes the exemption for a self-insured or self-funded employee welfare benefit plan under provisions regulating pharmacy benefits managers.","pending_committee_id":154,"committee":{"committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-11","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2022-01-26","committee_id":3876,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #3"},{"date":"2022-02-10","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22101659D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-01-26","action":"Assigned HWI sub: Subcommittee #3","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-08","action":"Subcommittee recommends continuing to 2023 by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-10","action":"Continued to 2023 in Health, Welfare and Institutions by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-22","action":"Left in Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":13746,"person_hash":"n5f6aafj","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Israel O'Quinn","first_name":"Israel","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"O'Quinn","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-005","ftm_eid":5705237,"votesmart_id":134667,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":361740,"ballotpedia":"Israel_O%27Quinn","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23016,"person_hash":"fosa81u0","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"H.
