Authorizes Dominion Energy Virginia to petition the State Corporation Commission (the Commission) for a financing order for deferred fuel costs. The bill sets forth specific transaction terms and other provisions related to the financing order. Before granting a financing order, the Commission is required to find that (i) the proposed issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds is in the public interest and the associated deferred fuel cost charges are just and reasonable and (ii) the structuring and pricing of the deferred fuel cost bonds are reasonably expected to result in reasonable deferred fuel cost charges consistent with market conditions at the time the deferred fuel cost bonds are priced and the terms set forth in such financing order. The bill requires the financing order to include, among other things: (a) the amount of deferred fuel costs to be financed using deferred fuel cost bonds (b) a requirement that deferred fuel cost charges authorized under a financing order are non-bypassable and paid by all retail customers of the electric utility, irrespective of the generation supplier of such customer, except for certain exempt customers; (c) A formula-based true-up mechanism for making annual adjustments to the deferred fuel cost charges; and (d) a method of tracing funds collected as deferred fuel cost charges. Under the bill, the financing order is irrevocable. Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act. Authorizes Dominion Energy Virginia to petition the State Corporation Commission (the Commission) for a financing order for deferred fuel costs. The bill sets forth specific transaction terms and other provisions related to the financing order. Before granting a financing order, the Commission is required to find that (i) the proposed issuance of deferred fuel cost bonds is in the public interest and the associated deferred fuel cost charges are just and reasonable and (ii) the structuring and pricing of the deferred fuel cost bonds are reasonably expected to result in reasonable deferred fuel cost charges consistent with market conditions at the time the deferred fuel cost bonds are priced and the terms set forth in such financing order. The bill requires the financing order to include, among other things: (a) the amount of deferred fuel costs to be financed using deferred fuel cost bonds (b) a requirement that deferred fuel cost charges authorized under a financing order are non-bypassable and paid by all retail customers of the electric utility, irrespective of the generation supplier of such customer, except for certain exempt customers; (c) A formula-based true-up mechanism for making annual adjustments to the deferred fuel cost charges; and (d) a method of tracing funds collected as deferred fuel cost charges. Under the bill, the financing order is irrevocable.  The bill creates the deferred fuel cost charge and provides that the revenues generated by this charge, known as deferred fuel cost property, is a property right that can be transferred and pledged as security for the deferred fuel cost bonds. The bill establishes the procedures for creating, perfecting, and enforcing the security interest in deferred fuel cost property. the bill includes a state non-impairment obligation. Under the bill if the deferred fuel costs bonds are issued, the Commonwealth and its agencies, including the Commission, agrees not to take any action that would limit or alter the deferred fuel cost charges until the deferred fuel cost bonds have been paid and performed in full.  The bill makes various changes to procedures under which the Commission reviews the earnings and sets the rates of investor-owned incumbent electric utilities. The bill requires that the Commission, in determining a fair rate of return on common equity for an investor-owned electric utility after January 1, 2023 and prior to December 31, 2027, not set such rate (i) lower than the average of the most recently authorized returns on common equity or weighted cost of equity set by the applicable regulatory commissions for all investor-owned electric utilities in the peer group of the utility or (ii) more than 150 basis points higher than such average. The bill eliminates a requirement that the Commission, in selecting the utility's peer group, eliminate from the peer group the utilities with the two lowest and the two highest returns and requires that a utility serve at least 200,000 retail electric customers to be considered part of the peer group.  The bill provides that, in lieu of the triennial review proceedings required under current law, Dominion Energy Virginia, beginning in 2023, will be subject to biennial reviews of their rates, terms, and conditions for generation, distribution, and transmission services. The bill requires that if, during a biennial review, the Commission determines that the utility has earned more than 70 basis points above its fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission will direct that 85 percent of the amount of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills. The bill provides that in any proceeding to establish base rates for Appalachian Electric Power or Dominion Energy Virginia conducted by the Commission, if the Commission determines in its sole discretion that the utility's existing base rates will, on a going-forward basis, either produce (i) revenues in excess of the utility's authorized rate of return or (ii) revenues below the utility's authorized rate of return, then the Commission is required to order any reductions or increases, as applicable and necessary, to such base rates that it deems appropriate to ensure the resulting base rates (a) are just and reasonable and (b) provide the utility an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services over the rate period and earn a fair rate of return. The bill provides that customer credit reinvestment offsets under which a utility is allowed, upon request, to reduce or eliminate amounts of overearnings that otherwise would be required to be credited to customers by applying a customer credit reinvestment offset for expenses on new solar and wind generation facilities and electric distribution grid transformation projects are only applicable to review proceedings initiated prior to January 1, 2024.  The bill requires Dominion Energy Virginia, in its 2023 biennial review, to combine certain rate adjustment clauses having a combined annual revenue requirement of at least $350 million with the utility's base rates. The bill provides that the combination of such rate adjustment clauses is subject to audit by the Commission in the utility's 2023 biennial review filing. The bill authorizes the Commission to, in its discretion, direct the consolidation of any previously implemented rate adjustment clauses in the interest of judicial economy, customer transparency, or other factors the Commission determines to be appropriate.  The bill requires Dominion Energy Virginia, throughout the duration of the construction period for certain offshore wind projects, to maintain, subject to audit by the Commission, its common equity capitalization to total capitalization ratio at a level at least equal to the average of such ratio for all utilities in Dominion's peer group investor-owned utilities. The bill contains technical amendments.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and
