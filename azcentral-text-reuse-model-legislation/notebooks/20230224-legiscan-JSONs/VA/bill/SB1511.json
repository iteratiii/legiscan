Allows a property that formerly participated in and continues to meet the qualifications of a state or federal soil and water conservation program but is no longer receiving payments or other compensation as a result of such program to continue to be eligible for designation as real estate devoted to agricultural use and real estate devoted to horticultural use. The bill further states that the presence of noxious weeds or woody growth shall not be the sole basis for denial of such classifications. Further, the bill requires that the application forms for taxation on the basis of a use assessment allow a landowner who received payments or compensation as a result of the former participation of their property in a state or federal soil and water conservation program, and whose property continues to meet the qualifications of such program but is no longer receiving such payments or compensation, to certify that the land continues to meet the requirements of such program for the purposes of classification.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-20","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and
