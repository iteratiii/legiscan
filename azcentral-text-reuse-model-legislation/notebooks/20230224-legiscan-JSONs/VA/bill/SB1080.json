Raises the maximum age for delinquency matters in juvenile and domestic relations district courts from persons under 18 years of age to persons under 21 years of age. The bill defines \"underage person\" as an individual who is 18 years of age or older but younger than 21 years of age. The bill adds underage persons to all provisions regarding delinquency proceedings in juvenile and domestic relations district courts, the transfer of delinquency matters to circuit courts, and criminal procedure as currently applies to juveniles only. The bill differentiates between juveniles and underage persons in specific circumstances, including consent for medical or mental health records or procedures, mental health screenings in secure detention facilities, and provisions regarding release on bail or recognizance.   The bill also specifies that a delinquent child is a child 11 years of age or older who has committed a delinquent act. Currently, there is no minimum age for a child to be adjudicated delinquent. The bill provides that if a juvenile younger than 11 years of age is found to have committed a delinquent act, the juvenile shall not be proceeded upon as delinquent; however, the court may make any orders of disposition authorized for a child in need of services or a child in need of supervision. The bill has a delayed effective date of January 1, 2025.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":4165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2023-01-30","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101977D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-09","action":"Referred to Committee on the Judiciary","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Reported from Judiciary (9-Y 6-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Rereferred to Finance and Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Passed by indefinitely in Finance and Appropriations (11-Y 5-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":766,"person_hash":"ib2vxbt5","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Edwards","first_name":"John","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Edwards","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-021","ftm_eid":13013704,"votesmart_id":8263,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":199403,"ballotpedia":"John_Edwards,_Virginia_Senator","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":17727,"person_hash":"day26lea","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Jennifer Boysko","first_name":"Jennifer","middle_name":"Barton","last_name":"Boysko","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-033","ftm_eid":6060458,"votesmart_id":144515,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":456390,"ballotpedia":"Jennifer_Boysko","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":1477,"person_hash":"k252k3q4","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Scott Surovell","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Surovell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-036","ftm_eid":5740451,"votesmart_id":115805,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":282953,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Surovell","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":204,"subject_name":"Courts Not of Record"},{"subject_id":175391,"subject_name":"Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2630058,"date":"2023-01-09","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB1080\/id\/2630058","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1080+hil","text_size":352816,"text_hash":"bf2c02774abf51f31bbdbe7fd78050ff"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1237978,"date":"2023-01-30","desc":"Senate: Reported from Judiciary (9-Y 6-N)","yea":9,"nay":6,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB1080\/id\/1237978","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S03V0113+SB1080"},{"roll_call_id":1241791,"date":"2023-02-02","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Finance and Appropriations (11-Y 5-N)","yea":11,"nay":5,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":16,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB1080\/id\/1241791","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S05V0291+SB1080"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":297040,"date":"2023-01-29","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101977D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB1080\/id\/297040","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB1080F122+PDF","supplement_size":93279,"supplement_hash":"94759f7d112d478a8f05c1e5f4d3f725"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-18","time":"00:00","location":"Senate Committee Room A \/ Pocahontas","description":"Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-23","time":"08:00","location":"Pocahontas Building","description":"Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-25","time":"00:00","location":"Senate Committee Room A \/ Pocahontas","description":"Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-30","time":"08:00","location":"Pocahontas Building","description":"Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-02","time":"16:30","location":"Shared Committee Room","description":"Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations Hearing"}]}}
