Establishes the Virginia Promise to Veterans Act for the purpose of removing barriers to higher education for veterans of the uniformed services, as defined in the bill, and assisting such veterans in making the transition to civilian life in the Commonwealth. In furtherance of this purpose, the bill directs the governing board of each public institution of higher education in the Commonwealth to provide for the guaranteed acceptance of any eligible veteran applicant, defined in the bill as any applicant who served as a member of the uniformed services and (i) graduated from a high school in the Commonwealth or (ii) served in the uniformed services while assigned to a location in the Commonwealth and who otherwise meets the admissions requirements to enroll as an undergraduate student at such institution. The bill requires the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, in collaboration with the Virginia Community College System, to develop guidelines relating to the administration of the provisions of the chapter for the governing board of each public institution of higher education and to develop guidelines for potential eligible veteran applicants, including any additional resources available to eligible veterans applying under the Act.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3892,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Higher Education"},{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
