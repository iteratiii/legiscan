The bill directs the Department of Medical Assistance Services to, in coordination with the Department of Corrections, identify persons confined in state correctional facilities who are enrolled in or may be eligible for services under the state plan for medical assistance and provide information to such persons regarding any steps necessary to obtain coverage for child birth prior to the person's release on medical furlough for the purpose of giving birth.","pending_committee_id":147,"committee":{"committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2023-01-25","committee_id":3875,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},{"date":"2023-02-01","committee_id":3851,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations: Health & Human Resources"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
