Establishes the Prescription Drug Affordability Board for the purpose of protecting the citizens of the Commonwealth and other stakeholders within the health care system from the high costs of prescription drug products. The bill directs the Governor to appoint the members and alternate members of the Board and requires the Board to meet in open session at least four times annually, with certain exceptions and requirements enumerated in the bill. Members of the Board are required to disclose any conflicts of interest, as described in the bill. The bill also creates a stakeholder council for the purpose of assisting the Board in making decisions related to drug cost affordability. The bill tasks the Board with identifying prescription, generic, and other drugs, as defined in the bill, that are offered for sale in the Commonwealth and, at the Board's discretion, conducting an affordability review of any prescription drug product. The bill lists factors for the Board to consider that indicate an affordability challenge for the health care system in the Commonwealth or high out-of-pocket costs for patients. The bill also provides that any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board may request an appeal of the Board's decision and that the Attorney General shall have authority to enforce the provisions of the bill. The bill also creates the Prescription Drug Affordability Fund to be used for funding the operations of the Board and reimbursing state agencies for implementing the provisions of the bill. The bill requires the Board to report its findings and recommendations to the General Assembly twice annually, beginning on July 1, 2024, and December 31, 2024. Provisions of the bill shall apply to state-sponsored and state-regulated health plans and health programs and obligate such policies to limit drug payment amounts and reimbursements to an upper payment limit amount set by the Board, if applicable, following an affordability review. The bill specifies that Medicare Part D plans shall not be bound by such decisions of the Board. The provisions of the bill are contingent on funding in a general appropriation act. Finally, the bill contains a severability clause and has a delayed effective date of January 1, 2024.","pending_committee_id":4570,"committee":{"committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-06","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor"},{"date":"2023-01-16","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"},{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},{"date":"2023-02-13","committee_id":4803,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy: Subcommittee #5"},{"date":"2023-02-22","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100215D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Introduced bill reprinted 23100215D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-16","action":"Reported from Commerce and Labor (11-Y 4-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-16","action":"Rereferred to Finance and Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Reported from Finance and Appropriations with amendments (13-Y 2-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Constitutional reading dispensed (40-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Read second time","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Reading of amendments waived","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Committee amendments agreed to","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Engrossed by Senate as amended SB957E","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Printed as engrossed 23100215D-E","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Read third time and passed Senate (25-Y 14-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Reconsideration of passage agreed to by Senate (38-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Passed Senate (26-Y 13-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Placed on Calendar","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Read first time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Referred to Committee on Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Assigned sub: Special Subcommittee #5","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (4-Y 2-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-22","action":"Left in Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":784,"person_hash":"d2x6eti0","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Petersen","first_name":"John","middle_name":"Chapman","last_name":"Petersen","suffix":"","nickname":"Chap","district":"SD-034","ftm_eid":5743839,"votesmart_id":50842,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":209953,"ballotpedia":"John_Chapman_%22Chap%22_Petersen","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":765,"person_hash":"c4bu5qw8","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Creigh Deeds","first_name":"R.
