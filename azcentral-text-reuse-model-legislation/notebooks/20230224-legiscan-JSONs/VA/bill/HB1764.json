Allows physician assistants practicing in hospitals, certain facilities operated by the Department of Behavioral Health and Development Services, or federally qualified health centers designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to practice without a practice agreement if the credentialing and privileging requirements of the applicable facility include a practice arrangement as described in the bill. The bill also eliminates the practice ratio for physicians and physician assistants; under current law, patient care team physicians and patient care team podiatrists are not allowed to collaborate or consult with more than six physician assistants at any one time.","pending_committee_id":154,"committee":{"committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3874,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103722D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-13","action":"Assigned HWI sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (4-Y 4-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":13730,"person_hash":"cvxqlta4","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Chris Head","first_name":"Chris","middle_name":"T.","last_name":"Head","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-017","ftm_eid":6700038,"votesmart_id":111190,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":361816,"ballotpedia":"Chris_Head","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":267,"subject_name":"Professions and Occupations"},{"subject_id":169212,"subject_name":"Physicians and Surgeons"},{"subject_id":354162,"subject_name":"Physician Assistants"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2630183,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1764\/id\/2630183","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1764+hil","text_size":15184,"text_hash":"a6dd2149f685e6d637dba272756efef0"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1234929,"date":"2023-01-24","desc":"House: Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (4-Y 4-N)","yea":4,"nay":4,"nv":0,"absent":1,"total":9,"passed":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1764\/id\/1234929","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H1201V0015+HB1764"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":152403,"adopted":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"date":"2023-01-24","title":"Substitute for HB1764 Health, Welfare and Institutions, Subcommittee #1","description":"Substitute for HB1764 Health, Welfare and Institutions, Subcommittee #1","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/HB1764\/id\/152403","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23105277D.pdf","amendment_size":27024,"amendment_hash":"de1a6595331ee6c397edebcb00af7bcf"}],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":295628,"date":"2023-01-25","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103722D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1764\/id\/295628","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1764F122+PDF","supplement_size":57787,"supplement_hash":"a43202fca189b9d9617821ddcf73edca"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-17","time":"00:00","location":"House Committee Room","description":"House Health, Welfare and Institutions - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-24","time":"07:30","location":"House Committee Room","description":"House Health, Welfare and Institutions - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
