Directs the State Water Control Board to waive the expiration of any ground water withdrawal permit for a well that serves exclusively residential users, is located in the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area north of the Occoquan River, and is located within five miles of any commercial or industrial permitted ground water withdrawal. The bill provides that such waiver shall continue in force until the commercial or industrial permitted ground water withdrawals have been halted for five years. The Department of Environmental Quality shall then assess whether the termination of the commercial or industrial permitted ground water withdrawals has substantially mitigated the stress upon the aquifer and redetermine whether the permit for the residential well shall be renewed.","pending_committee_id":146,"committee":{"committee_id":146,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":146,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources"},{"date":"2023-01-20","committee_id":4184,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources: Chesapeake"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":146,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101920D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-20","action":"Assigned ACNR sub: Chesapeake","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (4-Y 5-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17728,"person_hash":"k8zbghce","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Paul Krizek","first_name":"Paul","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Krizek","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-044","ftm_eid":5760434,"votesmart_id":156430,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":533281,"ballotpedia":"Paul_Krizek","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":169219,"subject_name":"Waters of the State Ports and Harbors"},{"subject_id":169220,"subject_name":"Groundwater"},{"subject_id":175314,"subject_name":"Wells"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2631856,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1977\/id\/2631856","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1977+hil","text_size":2099,"text_hash":"29079876570d8e611e56ed708160d7c9"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1237976,"date":"2023-01-30","desc":"House: Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (4-Y 5-N)","yea":4,"nay":5,"nv":0,"absent":1,"total":10,"passed":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1977\/id\/1237976","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0102V0011+HB1977"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-30","time":"16:00","location":"House Room 2, in the Capitol","description":"House Agriculture Chesapeake and Natural Resources - Chesapeake Subcommittee Hearing"}]}}
