Applicant Fingerprint Database; participation in FBI Next Generation Identification Rap Back Service, through Virginia Rap Back Service, for fingerprint-based criminal history record monitoring; penalty. Requires the Department of State Police (the Department) to participate in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Next Generation Identification (NGI) Record of Arrest and Prosecution (Rap) Back Service, through the Virginia Rap Back Service (the Service), for the purpose of allowing those agencies and governmental entities that require a fingerprint-based criminal background check as a condition of (i) providing care to (a) children, (b) the disabled, or (c) the elderly or (ii) (a) licensure, (b) certification, (c) employment, or (d) volunteer service to be advised when an individual subject to such screening is arrested for, or convicted of, a criminal offense. The bill provides that fingerprints submitted to the FBI through the Virginia Rap Back Service may be used for future searches, including latent searches.  The bill requires the Department to ensure that notification is made to the participating entity, defined in the bill, when an FBI Rap Back report is received. Any unauthorized use of the information submitted to the Service is prohibited; any willful violation with the intent to harass or intimidate another is a Class 1 misdemeanor. The bill requires the Department to promulgate regulations governing the Service and the removal and destruction of records on persons who are deceased or are no longer enrolled in the Service. The bill provides that such regulations shall provide that a participating entity shall disenroll any individual who is deceased or is no longer an individual, as defined in the bill, within 30 days of death or such event that no longer requires such individual to be enrolled in the Virginia Rap Back Service in order to ensure the prompt removal and destruction of records from the Virginia Rap Back Service. The bill authorizes the Department to charge a $12 fee per individual enrolled in the Service, paid by any participating entity enrolling the individual in the Service, and provides that when more than one participating agency enrolls the same individual in the Service, both entities shall be responsible for paying the full cost for maintenance and notification. The bill requires that any fees collected shall be deposited in a special account to offset costs of subscription fees, maintenance fees, and enhancements related to the Criminal and Rap Back Information Service. Under current law, the Department maintains an Applicant Fingerprint Database (the Database) that functions similarly to the Service. The bill transitions the Department from using the Database and requires the Service to be operational no later than July 1, 2025, contingent upon appropriation of funds.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":4177,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Public
