Requires a court to establish a program and allow any person upon whom a fine and costs have been imposed to discharge all or part of the fine or costs by earning credits for the performance of community service work or work performed while incarcerated, defined in the bill as any work done on or after July 1, 2020, by a person confined in any penal or corrective institution of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions who is paid a wage that is less than the Virginia minimum wage.   The bill requires such program be available during imprisonment in a local, regional, or state correctional facility. The bill provides that a person who is performing work while incarcerated shall be credited at the same rate as the community service work rate less any wages received. Under current law, a court is required to establish a program for providing an option for community service work in lieu of payment of fines and costs but offering such option is not mandatory.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23104027D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Assigned Courts sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17806,"person_hash":"ttoyitxx","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Marcia Price","first_name":"Marcia","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Price","suffix":"","nickname":"Cia","district":"HD-095","ftm_eid":32013300,"votesmart_id":156448,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":533396,"ballotpedia":"Marcia_Price","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":207,"subject_name":"Criminal Procedure"},{"subject_id":21075,"subject_name":"Fines and Costs"},{"subject_id":175306,"subject_name":"Correctional Enterprises"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2633285,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB2159\/id\/2633285","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB2159+hil","text_size":9743,"text_hash":"ffdce381b440e6e38ed13dc66fbcfbd5"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1232758,"date":"2023-01-18","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (5-Y 3-N)","yea":5,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB2159\/id\/1232758","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0801V0090+HB2159"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-18","time":"00:00","location":"House Room 3","description":"House Courts of Justice - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
