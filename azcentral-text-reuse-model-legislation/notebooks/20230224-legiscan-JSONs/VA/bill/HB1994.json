Allows individuals who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence who have resided in the United States for no less than 60 months and who are both eligible for and have applied for United States citizenship to qualify for the positions of chief of police and all police officers of any locality, all deputy sheriffs and jail officers in the Commonwealth, and all law-enforcement officers. The bill allows any agency or department employing law-enforcement officers to hire, recruit, or refer an individual who is a citizen of the United States over another individual who meets such qualifications if such individuals are equally qualified.   Current law only allows citizens of the United States to qualify for the named positions; the citizenship requirement can only be waived for good cause upon request of a sheriff or chief of police or the director or chief executive of any agency or department employing law-enforcement officers to the Department of Criminal Justice Services.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"},{"date":"2023-01-23","committee_id":3855,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-03","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102269D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Assigned CC & T sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-27","action":"Subcommittee recommends reporting (5-Y 4-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Referred from Counties, Cities and Towns by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":894,"person_hash":"y4inknoi","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Charniele Herring","first_name":"Charniele","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Herring","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-046","ftm_eid":5761539,"votesmart_id":110912,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":275445,"ballotpedia":"Charniele_Herring","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19440,"person_hash":"yl6g82ws","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Guzman","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Guzman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-031","ftm_eid":43620466,"votesmart_id":176356,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620436,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Guzman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":21412,"person_hash":"p44fto4a","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Avoli","first_name":"G.","middle_name":"","last_name":"Avoli","suffix":"","nickname":"John","district":"HD-020","ftm_eid":47299313,"votesmart_id":186412,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":702481,"ballotpedia":"John_Avoli","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
