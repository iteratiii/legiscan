Removes the sunset for the motion picture production tax credit, which currently is set to expire after taxable year 2026. The bill increases the aggregate limit on credits from $6.5 million to $15 million starting with fiscal year 2021 and also provides that credits allocated for episodic content, gaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality productions shall not count against the aggregate limit. The bill provides that if the amount of credits actually claimed is less than the aggregate limit for that year, the unclaimed remainder shall be added to the limit for the next year. The bill authorizes credits to be issued for multiyear periods. Under current law, if production continues for more than one year, the taxpayer must file a separate application for each year.","pending_committee_id":152,"committee":{"committee_id":152,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-11","committee_id":152,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance"},{"date":"2022-01-20","committee_id":3867,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2022-02-07","committee_id":152,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Finance"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22102951D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on Finance","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-01-20","action":"Assigned Finance sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-04","action":"Subcommittee recommends continuing to 2023 by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-02-07","action":"Continued to 2023 in Finance by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-22","action":"Left in Finance","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21446,"person_hash":"os5vjo87","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Don Scott","first_name":"Don","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Scott","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"HD-080","ftm_eid":48307624,"votesmart_id":186771,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":714354,"ballotpedia":"Don_Scott","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23040,"person_hash":"bekkq5bg","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jackie Glass","first_name":"Jackie","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Glass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-089","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":201393,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":795351,"ballotpedia":"Jackie_Glass_(Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":9,"type":"Carry Over","sast_bill_number":"HB589","sast_bill_id":1551433}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":239,"subject_name":"Income Tax"},{"subject_id":289,"subject_name":"Taxation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2609597,"date":"2022-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB589\/id\/2609597","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB589+hil","text_size":11746,"text_hash":"db0ca282a5d0ad4bc70bda9355a354a6"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":286118,"date":"2022-06-20","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22102951D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB589\/id\/286118","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB589F161+PDF","supplement_size":127603,"supplement_hash":"6e737cdb559d4114a44cd41b5411205d"}],"calendar":[]}}
