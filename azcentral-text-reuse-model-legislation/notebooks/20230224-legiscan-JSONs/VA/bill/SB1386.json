Requires each public institution of higher education to create and maintain a form by which a student may apply for a dependency override, defined in the bill as the documented determination by a financial aid administrator pursuant to relevant federal law that, for the purposes of tuition and financial aid eligibility determinations, a student is an independent student by reason of other unusual circumstances. The bill requires such form to (i) be published electronically on the financial aid page of the institution's website; (ii) clearly explain, in language understandable to a student enrolled at the institution, the purposes of a dependency override, potential circumstances that may qualify a student for a dependency override, and common circumstances that do not qualify a student for a dependency override; (iii) explicitly include, in language understandable to a student enrolled at the institution, a statement that institutions of higher education are permitted to accept a range of documents to substantiate dependency override applications, including those documents specified by relevant federal law; and (iv) explicitly include, in language understandable to a student enrolled at the institution, the option to apply for a dependency override based on certain factors enumerated in the bill. Finally, the bill provides that its provisions shall not be construed to limit the circumstances under which the financial aid office of any public institution of higher education may grant a dependency override or expand access to a dependency override as provided by federal law and guidance.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3892,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Higher Education"},{"date":"2023-01-26","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"},{"date":"2023-02-13","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-02-13","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103844D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on Education and Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-13","action":"Assigned Education sub: Higher Education","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Reported from Education and Health with substitute (12-Y 0-N 3-A)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Committee substitute printed 23105099D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Rereferred to Finance and Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Reported from Finance and Appropriations with amendment (16-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Constitutional reading dispensed (40-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Read second time","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Reading of substitute waived","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Committee substitute agreed to 23105099D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Reading of amendment waived","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Committee amendment agreed to","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Engrossed by Senate - committee substitute with amendment SB1386ES1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Printed as engrossed 23105099D-ES1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Read third time and passed Senate (39-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Placed on Calendar","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Read first time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Referred to Committee on Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Reported from Education (22-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Referred to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-15","action":"Tabled in Appropriations (11-Y 10-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":765,"person_hash":"c4bu5qw8","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Creigh Deeds","first_name":"R.
