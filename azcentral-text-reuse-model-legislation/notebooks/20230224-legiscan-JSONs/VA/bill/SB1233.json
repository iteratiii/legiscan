The bill provides that for violations of certain distance and zoning restrictions on outdoor advertising, as set forth in the bill, the Board must give the advertiser written notice to take corrective action and that, if such corrective action is not taken within 30 days, the advertiser is guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. The bill establishes numerous restrictions on marijuana advertisements, including provisions that prohibit advertisements from (i) targeting minors; (ii) being placed near schools, playgrounds, and certain other places; (iii) being displayed at a sporting event or on a billboard; (iv) being misleading, deceptive, or false; (v) referencing the intoxicating effects of marijuana; or (vi) promoting
