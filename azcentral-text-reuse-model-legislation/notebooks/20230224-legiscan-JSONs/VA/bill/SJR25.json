Directs the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to study whether a stand-alone gaming oversight agency would allow for more focused oversight of all types of legal gaming in the Commonwealth and alleviate potential conflicts of interest by (i) evaluating whether the current oversight and regulatory structure of the different types of legal gaming result in varying compliance standards with regard to similar gaming devices which could unintentionally cause a competitive advantage to one industry over another; (ii) reporting on the current costs for each existing gaming oversight agency to regulate the gaming for which it is responsible; (iii) determining whether the overall costs to oversee, regulate, and enforce violations of legal gaming in the Commonwealth would be lower if all such types of gaming were housed under a stand-alone gaming oversight agency; (iv) conducting research to determine potential methods of housing, and the steps necessary to house, all legalized gaming under a stand-alone gaming oversight agency; and (v) determining the potential necessity for and specific composition of a centralized gaming oversight board that would best ensure compliance with ethical requirements and a substantial decrease in the number of potential conflicts of interest.","pending_committee_id":169,"committee":{"committee_id":169,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-11","committee_id":169,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22102783D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on Rules","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-01-28","action":"Continued to 2023 in Rules by voice vote","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-21","action":"Left in Rules","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":13743,"person_hash":"w2xkg2h8","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Bryce Reeves","first_name":"Bryce","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Reeves","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-017","ftm_eid":6699971,"votesmart_id":134699,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":362256,"ballotpedia":"Bryce_Reeves","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":17744,"person_hash":"45s6ym5w","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Bell","first_name":"John","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Bell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-013","ftm_eid":13007300,"votesmart_id":112204,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":465880,"ballotpedia":"John_Bell_(Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":9,"type":"Carry Over","sast_bill_number":"SJR25","sast_bill_id":1559110}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":372,"subject_name":"Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC)"},{"subject_id":169164,"subject_name":"Study Commissions Committees and Reports"},{"subject_id":169226,"subject_name":"Gambling Lotteries Etc."}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2609655,"date":"2022-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SJR25\/id\/2609655","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SJ25+hil","text_size":4712,"text_hash":"76d4aa1316b18f9e0cc38b331233f5a0"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
