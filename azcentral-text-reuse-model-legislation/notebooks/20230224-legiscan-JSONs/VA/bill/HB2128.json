Requires any person having possession of a small asset belonging to a decedent, upon presentation of an affidavit by the funeral service establishment handling the disposition of the decedent and any related funeral service, to pay or deliver to such funeral service establishment so much of the small asset as does not exceed the amount given priority and has not already been paid. Under current law, such payment is discretionary and made to the undertaker or mortuary. The bill also provides for the discharge and release of a person paying or delivering a small asset in accordance with the provisions of the bill to the same extent as if such person dealt with the personal representative of the decedent. The bill provides that if any person to whom an affidavit is presented refuses to pay or deliver any small asset, such small asset may be recovered, payment or delivery compelled, and damages recovered, on proof of rightful claim, unless such refusal was made in good faith.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of
