Changes the contingency for the effective date of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Implementation Plan to (i) allow consideration of a combination of point or nonpoint source pollution reduction efforts other than agricultural best management conservation practices when determining whether the Commonwealth's agriculture sector commitments in the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan have been satisfied and (ii) bar such provisions from becoming effective unless the Commonwealth has fully funded the Virginia Natural Resources Commitment Fund as provided in the bill. The bill also advances from July 1, 2026, to July 1, 2030, the contingency effective date of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Implementation Plan (the Plan). The bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry and the Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources to convene a stakeholder advisory group to review annual progress and make certain recommendations toward the implantation of the Commonwealth's agricultural commitments in the Plan. The bill directs each soil and water conservation district to report to the Department any recommendations for improving the disbursement of funds from the Virginia Natural Resources Commitment Fund and program efficiencies that would expedite the disbursal of such funds. Finally, the bill prohibits any regulatory action to be imposed on agricultural practices before the effective date of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Implementation Plan.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-01","committee_id":146,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural
