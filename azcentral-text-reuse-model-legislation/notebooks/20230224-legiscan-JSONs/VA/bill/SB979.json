Prohibits localities from setting limits on towing fees and other associated fees for trespassing passenger cars and vehicles that are lower than the respective statewide maximum charges authorized for such fees in localities without a local ordinance setting towing fees; removes current specified limits for Planning Districts 8 and 16 that would fall below those limits; and requires an ordinance adopted by a locality that sets such limits to provide that no more than two additional fees can be charged for towing any vehicle between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. or on any Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. The bill changes current statewide trespass towing fee limits on hookup and initial towing fees of passenger cars from $150 to $180 and additional fees for towing between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. or on any Saturday, Sunday, or holiday from $30 to $35.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-06","committee_id":170,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100534D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Referred to Committee on Transportation","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-02","action":"Passed by indefinitely in Transportation (15-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":712,"person_hash":"ruiwcr21","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Dave Marsden","first_name":"Dave","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Marsden","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-037","ftm_eid":6467010,"votesmart_id":58666,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":241244,"ballotpedia":"Dave_Marsden","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":254,"subject_name":"Motor Vehicles"},{"subject_id":169211,"subject_name":"Towing Services and Tow Trucks"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2625644,"date":"2023-01-06","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB979\/id\/2625644","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB979+hil","text_size":4932,"text_hash":"5df8d2cefca3475c39951c34c4faf80a"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1241662,"date":"2023-02-02","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Transportation (15-Y 0-N)","yea":15,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB979\/id\/1241662","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S11V0049+SB0979"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":294260,"date":"2023-01-23","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100534D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB979\/id\/294260","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB979F122+PDF","supplement_size":64750,"supplement_hash":"c241b2b7c5528ef7a5f3e7cd7d1a16cd"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-02","time":"00:00","location":"Committee Room #3 - Capitol Ext.","description":"Senate Committee on Transportation Hearing"}]}}
