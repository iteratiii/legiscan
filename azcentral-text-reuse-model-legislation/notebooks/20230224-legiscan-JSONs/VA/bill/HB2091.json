Adds an exception to the right of parental access to a minor child's health records if the furnishing to or review by the requesting parent of such health records would be reasonably likely deter the minor from seeking care. Under the bill, a minor 16 years of age or older who is determined by a health care provider to be mature and capable of giving informed consent shall be deemed an adult for the purpose of giving consent to treatment of a mental or emotional disorder. The bill provides that the capacity of a minor to consent to treatment of a mental or emotional disorder does not include the capacity to (i) refuse treatment for a mental or emotional disorder for which a parent, guardian, or custodian of the minor has given consent or (ii) if the minor is under 16 years of age, consent to the use of prescription medications to treat a mental or emotional disorder.","pending_committee_id":154,"committee":{"committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2023-01-24","committee_id":3875,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102392D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Assigned HWI sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (6-Y 4-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":22416,"person_hash":"w39hq3xq","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Candi Mundon King","first_name":"Candi","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mundon King","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-002","ftm_eid":52701188,"votesmart_id":195689,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":762107,"ballotpedia":"Candi_King","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19249,"person_hash":"q3eygcg7","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jeffrey Bourne","first_name":"Jeffrey","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Bourne","suffix":"","nickname":"Jeff","district":"HD-071","ftm_eid":43550090,"votesmart_id":176092,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":615380,"ballotpedia":"Jeff_Bourne","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23034,"person_hash":"4r2lyyzs","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nadarius Clark","first_name":"Nadarius","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":53400342,"votesmart_id":196001,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773076,"ballotpedia":"Nadarius_Clark","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19470,"person_hash":"4ikqyjkc","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Wendy Gooditis","first_name":"Wendy","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Gooditis","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-010","ftm_eid":43970626,"votesmart_id":176543,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":621354,"ballotpedia":"Wendy_Gooditis","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19440,"person_hash":"yl6g82ws","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Guzman","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Guzman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-031","ftm_eid":43620466,"votesmart_id":176356,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620436,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Guzman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":5,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":18551,"person_hash":"dtc0pdro","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"C.E.
