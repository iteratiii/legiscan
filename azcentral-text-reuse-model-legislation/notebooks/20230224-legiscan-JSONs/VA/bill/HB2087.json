Requires employers to provide paid sick leave to health care providers and grocery store workers. Under current law, employers are only required to provide paid sick leave to certain home health workers. The bill removes requirements that workers work on average at least 20 hours per week or 90 hours per month to be eligible for paid sick leave. The bill provides that certain health care providers may waive their right to accrue and use paid sick leave and provides an exemption for employers of certain other health care providers. The bill requires the Department of Labor and Industry to develop guidelines for retail employers that sell groceries to provide sick leave and to publish such guidelines by December 1, 2023. The provisions of the bill other than the requirement for the Department of Labor and Industry to develop guidelines have a delayed effective date of January 1, 2024.","pending_committee_id":4570,"committee":{"committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},{"date":"2023-01-25","committee_id":4583,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy: Subcommittee #4"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
