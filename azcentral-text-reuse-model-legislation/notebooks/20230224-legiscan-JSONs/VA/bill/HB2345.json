Renames the Emergency Department Care Coordination Program as the Smartchart Network Program and expands the Program to allow participation by all health care providers, insurance carriers, and other organizations with a treatment, payment, or operations relationship with a patient in the Commonwealth to facilitate real-time communication and collaboration. Under current law, participation is limited to hospital emergency departments. The bill makes several other modifications to the Program, including adding a requirement that the Program allow health care providers, health care entities, and insurance carriers to access information necessary to evaluate and monitor the care and treatment of a patient in accordance with applicable patient privacy and security requirements and adding a requirement that such entities continue to improve care coordination in hospital emergency departments in order to reduce the frequency of visits by high-volume emergency department utilizers. The bill also directs the State Health Commissioner and the Director of the Department of Medical Assistance Services to convene a work group to study and establish a plan to develop and implement a system to share information regarding a patient's prescription history and medication reconciliation. The bill requires the Commissioner and the Director to report their findings and recommendations to the Chairmen of the Joint Commission on Health Care, Senate Committee on Education and Health, and House Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions by October 1, 2023. The provisions of the bill other than creation of the work group have a delayed effective date of January 1, 2024.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":3875,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},{"date":"2023-02-01","committee_id":3851,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations: Health & Human Resources"},{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-02-16","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance and Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Presented and ordered printed 23103961D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Referred to Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Assigned HWI sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Subcommittee recommends reporting with amendments (10-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Reported from Health, Welfare and Institutions with amendment(s) (20-Y 1-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Referred to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Assigned App. sub: Health & Human Resources","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Subcommittee recommends reporting with amendments (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Reported from Appropriations with amendment(s) (22-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-03","action":"Read first time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Read second time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions amendments agreed to","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Committee on Appropriations amendments agreed to","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Engrossed by House as amended HB2345E","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-06","action":"Printed as engrossed 23103961D-E","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Read third time and passed House (98-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"VOTE: Passage (98-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Constitutional reading dispensed","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Referred to Committee on Education and Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Reported from Education and Health with substitute (15-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Committee substitute printed 23107069D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Rereferred to Finance and Appropriations","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Reported from Finance and Appropriations (16-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Constitutional reading dispensed (40-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Read third time","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Reading of substitute waived","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Committee substitute agreed to 23107069D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Engrossed by Senate -
