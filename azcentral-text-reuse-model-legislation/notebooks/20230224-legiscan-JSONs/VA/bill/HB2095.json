Requires the State Water Control Board to recognize service areas for water utilities in the Commonwealth that use the Potomac River as a water supply source as a distinct drought evaluation region. The bill requires the Board to incorporate certain provisions from the Metropolitan Washington Water Supply and Drought Awareness Response Plan: Potomac River System (the Metropolitan Washington Plan) into the existing drought evaluation and response plans that are applicable to the Potomac River drought evaluation region. The bill directs the Board to adopt regulations that further recognize the localities that include any portion of the service area of a water supply utility in the Commonwealth that uses the Potomac River as a water supply source as a distinct regional planning area. The bill requires such regulations to incorporate certain provisions from the Metropolitan Washington Plan. The bill provides that the incorporation of such provisions shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Governor during a declared drought
