Declares that the General Assembly has the sole authority to impose immunization requirements on students enrolled in public institutions of higher education and any policy or any revision to any policy of a public institution of higher education relating to immunization requirements is void to the extent that it is inconsistent with the law of the Commonwealth. The bill also expands the scope of exemptions from such immunization requirements by (i) providing that any student shall be exempt from the immunization requirements or from the health history requirement if the student or, if such student is under the age of 18, the parent of such student objects on the grounds that compliance with the requirement would conflict with the student's or the parent's religious tenets or practices and (ii) removing the exception providing that the religious exemption to any immunization requirement shall not apply if the Board of Health declares an emergency or epidemic of disease.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-06","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-01-20","committee_id":3892,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Higher Education"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102704D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Referred to Committee on Education and Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-20","action":"Assigned Education sub: Higher Education","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Passed by indefinitely in Education and Health (9-Y 6-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":18932,"person_hash":"bp623va5","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Peake","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Peake","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-022","ftm_eid":5804871,"votesmart_id":134491,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":533107,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Peake","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":169287,"subject_name":"Higher Education"},{"subject_id":175300,"subject_name":"Institutions of Higher Education; Other Educational and Cultural Institutions"},{"subject_id":175401,"subject_name":"Immunizations"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2625583,"date":"2023-01-06","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB991\/id\/2625583","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB991+hil","text_size":5008,"text_hash":"66635f8420f4f0e15eb929ed97ae198a"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1236216,"date":"2023-01-26","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Education and Health (9-Y 6-N)","yea":9,"nay":6,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB991\/id\/1236216","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S04V0099+SB0991"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":291332,"date":"2023-01-16","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102704D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB991\/id\/291332","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB991F122+PDF","supplement_size":58585,"supplement_hash":"d5d8ec308fee5619e3d4d2a100d71551"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-23","time":"00:00","location":"Subcommittee Room 2","description":"Senate Education and Health - Subcommittee Higher Education Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-26","time":"08:00","location":"Senate Room A","description":"Senate Committee on Education and Health Hearing"}]}}
