Delays from July 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024, the date by which vehicles claiming a farm use exemption are required to obtain a farm use placard from the Department of Motor Vehicles and display such placard at all times. The bill provides that the requirement to display a farm use placard only applies to pickup or panel trucks and sport utility vehicles. The bill removes certain requirements on the application for a farm use placard, prohibits requesting additional information on such application, and prohibits disclosure of application information. The bill authorizes the use of an agricultural or horticultural vehicle for disposing of incidental refuse and a seasonal transportation vehicle for driving to a storage house, packing plant, or market regardless of distance. The bill clarifies that the exemption for transporting back to a farm essential food includes procuring a meal for a farmer or his employees and that such exemption applies while engaged in authorized farm vehicle uses. The bill exempts vehicles required to obtain a farm use placard from the motor vehicle sales and use tax and authorizes localities to exempt such vehicles from personal property tax.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"},{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":3885,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation:
