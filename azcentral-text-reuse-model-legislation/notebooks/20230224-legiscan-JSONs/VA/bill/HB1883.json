Repeals the requirement for the owner or lessee of a vehicle claiming a farm use exemption from the registration, licensing, and decal requirements for a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer to obtain a nontransferable permanent farm use placard from the Department of Motor Vehicles and to display the farm use placard on the vehicle at all times. Under current law, such requirement will become effective July 1, 2023. The bill reinstates the authority of law-enforcement officers to inquire about the address or real property parcel identification number of the farm or lands with which the exempt vehicle is associated. The bill prohibits any person from displaying a farm use tag, plate, or placard or otherwise claiming a farm use exemption to which he is not entitled while operating an unregistered vehicle on a highway and provides penalties of $100 for a first violation, $200 for a second violation, and $500 for a third or subsequent violation. The bill requires the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to convene a workgroup of relevant stakeholders to identify issues and develop recommendations for improvements regarding farm use vehicle exemptions from vehicle registration and the use and display of farm use vehicle tags.","pending_committee_id":159,"committee":{"committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3885,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101774D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Transportation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-13","action":"Assigned Transportation sub: Subcommittee #1 Department of Motor Vehicles","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Subcommittee recommends incorporating (HB1806-Bloxom) by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Transportation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17740,"person_hash":"7nw83gkc","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nicholas Freitas","first_name":"Nicholas","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Freitas","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-030","ftm_eid":32011420,"votesmart_id":156651,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":533261,"ballotpedia":"Nick_Freitas","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":254,"subject_name":"Motor Vehicles"},{"subject_id":169164,"subject_name":"Study Commissions Committees and Reports"},{"subject_id":169238,"subject_name":"Law-Enforcement Officers"},{"subject_id":169272,"subject_name":"Farmers Farm Produce and Equipment"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2631867,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1883\/id\/2631867","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1883+hil","text_size":19653,"text_hash":"4422b4bc2a590d1c275c5c86d6bd7c8f"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":295650,"date":"2023-01-25","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101774D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1883\/id\/295650","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1883F122+PDF","supplement_size":61830,"supplement_hash":"14ee692deaa24fb960e02f49f1775af3"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-24","time":"08:00","location":"House Room 3","description":"House Transportation - Subcommittee #1 Department of Motor Vehicles Committee Hearing"}]}}
