Sets out statutory protections for an individual's right to access and a health care provider's right to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception. The bill prohibits measures that single out and impede access to contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information. However, a party may defend against a claim that a measure violates the bill's prohibitions by demonstrating through clear and convincing evidence that the measure significantly advances access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception and cannot be advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure or action. The Office of the Attorney General, individuals, or health care providers may bring a lawsuit to enforce the provisions of the bill, and localities are not immune from suits for violations.","pending_committee_id":4570,"committee":{"committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-01-28","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-01","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100152D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-28","action":"Assigned Courts sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Referred from Courts of Justice by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Referred to Committee on Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
