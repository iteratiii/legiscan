Permits the Norfolk State University Board of Visitors and the Virginia State University Board of Visitors to charge reduced rate tuition to any non-Virginia student who has completed at least 30 credit hours of course work and is enrolled in a program at the relevant institution that leads to employment in a high-demand field, as determined by the board of visitors of the relevant institution based on data compiled and provided by the Virginia Office of Education Economics. The bill provides that in the event that a non-Virginia student who was charged reduced rate tuition at the relevant institution in accordance with the provisions of the bill withdraws from the program that leads to employment in a high-demand field and enrolls in a program that does not lead to employment in a high-demand field, such student will forfeit eligibility for reduced rate tuition charge and shall be charged tuition at the full rate for non-Virginia students. The bill further provides that any non-Virginia student at Norfolk State University or Virginia State University who was initially enrolled in a program that does not lead to employment in a high-demand field but withdraws from that program and enrolls in a program that does lead to employment in a high-demand field may be charged reduced rate tuition in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
