Authorizes any locality to authorize, by ordinance, its local law-enforcement agency to place and operate photo speed monitoring devices in certain locations named in the ordinance, provided that (i) the highway has a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or greater; (ii) the ordinance identifies the locality-designated speeding offense to be enforced by the photo speed monitoring device; (iii) speeding, crash, or fatality data supports the need for stronger enforcement against speeding; and (iv) in counties and towns whose roads are subject to the control and jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, the locality-designated highway segment is in the secondary state highway system. The bill directs the locality to also identify the speeding violations that may be enforced by photo speed monitoring device.
