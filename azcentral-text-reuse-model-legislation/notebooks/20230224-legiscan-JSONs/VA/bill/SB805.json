Removes the authority for a locality by ordinance to prohibit the possession or carrying of firearms, ammunition, or components or any combination thereof in (i) any building, or part thereof, owned or used by such locality for governmental purposes; (ii) any public park owned or operated by the locality; (iii) any recreation or community center facility; or (iv) any public street, road, alley, or sidewalk or public right-of-way or any other place of whatever nature that is open to the public and is being used by or is adjacent to a permitted event or an event that would otherwise require a permit. The bill provides that any firearm received by the locality pursuant to a buy-back program shall be offered for sale by public auction or sealed bids to a person licensed as a dealer. Current law provides that any such firearm shall be destroyed by the locality unless the person surrendering the firearm requests in writing that the firearm be offered for sale. The bill also limits the authority of localities to bring lawsuits against certain firearms manufacturers and others and further provides that the right to bring any such action is reserved exclusively to the Commonwealth and shall be brought by the Attorney General.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2022-12-09","committee_id":4165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Judiciary"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-12-09","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100913D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-12-09","action":"Referred to Committee on the Judiciary","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Passed by indefinitely in Judiciary (10-Y 5-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17747,"person_hash":"20byu1wu","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Amanda Chase","first_name":"Amanda","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Chase","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-011","ftm_eid":29336561,"votesmart_id":156454,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":533157,"ballotpedia":"Amanda_Chase","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":301,"subject_name":"Weapons"},{"subject_id":169168,"subject_name":"Counties Cities and Towns"},{"subject_id":169203,"subject_name":"Firearms"},{"subject_id":175222,"subject_name":"Ordinances"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2618250,"date":"2022-12-09","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB805\/id\/2618250","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB805+hil","text_size":11209,"text_hash":"cd02ce5835902d2a9eb8dce7e8afdcf9"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1237989,"date":"2023-01-30","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Judiciary (10-Y 5-N)","yea":10,"nay":5,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB805\/id\/1237989","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S03V0092+SB0805"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":293988,"date":"2023-01-23","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100913D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB805\/id\/293988","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB805F122+PDF","supplement_size":63000,"supplement_hash":"ed345560b78a3f3cff7f489e89d0b654"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-23","time":"08:00","location":"Pocahontas Building","description":"Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-30","time":"08:00","location":"Pocahontas Building","description":"Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing"}]}}
