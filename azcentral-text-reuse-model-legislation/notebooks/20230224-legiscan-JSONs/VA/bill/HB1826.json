Prohibits any person from converting contributions to a candidate or his campaign committee for personal use. Current law only prohibits such conversion of contributions with regard to disbursement of surplus funds at the dissolution of a campaign or political committee. The bill provides that a contribution is considered to have been converted to personal use if the contribution, in whole or in part, is used to fulfill any commitment, obligation, or expense that would exist irrespective of the person's seeking, holding, or maintaining public office but allows a contribution to be used for the ordinary and accepted expenses related to campaigning for or holding elective office, including the use of campaign funds to pay for the candidate's child care expenses that are incurred as a direct result of campaign activity. The bill provides that any person subject to the personal use ban may request an advisory opinion from the State Board of Elections on such matters. The bill directs the State Board of Elections to adopt emergency regulations to implement the provisions of the bill and to provide an updated summary of Virginia campaign finance law that reflects the State Board of Elections' and Attorney General's guidance on the provisions of such law that prohibit the personal use of campaign funds and any new regulations promulgated by the State Board of Elections.","pending_committee_id":156,"committee":{"committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},{"date":"2023-01-30","committee_id":3880,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100204D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Assigned P & E sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23018,"person_hash":"xmj1ld3a","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Mike Cherry","first_name":"Mike","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Cherry","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-066","ftm_eid":53400411,"votesmart_id":195992,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773166,"ballotpedia":"Mike_Cherry","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":16061,"person_hash":"ybv76irj","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Marcus Simon","first_name":"Marcus","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Simon","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-053","ftm_eid":15117155,"votesmart_id":144836,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":465846,"ballotpedia":"Marcus_Simon","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23037,"person_hash":"3ekh3jhb","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Irene Shin","first_name":"Irene","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shin","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-086","ftm_eid":53400349,"votesmart_id":196026,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773087,"ballotpedia":"Irene_Shin","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":174,"subject_name":"Administration of Government"},{"subject_id":215,"subject_name":"Elections"},{"subject_id":169159,"subject_name":"Campaign Practices"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2630967,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1826\/id\/2630967","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1826+hil","text_size":59571,"text_hash":"9bb80e2fda6645dff0602ef0537864ab"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1239473,"date":"2023-02-01","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (5-Y 3-N)","yea":5,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1826\/id\/1239473","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H1802V0009+HB1826"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":290550,"date":"2023-01-12","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100204D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1826\/id\/290550","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1826F160+PDF","supplement_size":35448,"supplement_hash":"21e436a06188a58facb76e412285c490"},{"supplement_id":293947,"date":"2023-01-23","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Impact statement from DPB (HB1826)","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1826\/id\/293947","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1826F122+PDF","supplement_size":66016,"supplement_hash":"0a6d2164f9062fcaed94df0870b38a29"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-01","time":"07:00","location":"House Room 1","description":"House Privileges and Elections - Subcommittee #2 Committee Hearing"}]}}
