Provides that when a qualifying emergency, as defined in the bill, is in effect, a residential customer who can demonstrate that he has less than a 24-hour supply of petroleum gas in his liquefied petroleum gas container shall make a good faith effort to procure delivery of liquefied petroleum gas from the owner of the container. If the owner is unable to fulfill the customer's good faith request within 24 hours, the bill allows the customer to have an emergency supplier fill, refill, or otherwise deliver liquefied petroleum gas into the customer's container. The bill requires the owner of the container within five business days of filling, refilling, or otherwise delivering liquified petroleum gas to the container. Under current law, it is a Class 3 misdemeanor for any person except the owner or other person authorized by the owner to fill or refill a liquefied petroleum gas container with liquefied petroleum gas.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":4165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2023-01-18","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor"},{"date":"2023-02-08","committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy"},{"date":"2023-02-13","committee_id":4578,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and Energy: Subcommittee #1"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100116D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on the Judiciary","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Rereferred from Judiciary (10-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Rereferred to Commerce and Labor","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Reported from Commerce and Labor with substitute (14-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Committee substitute printed 23105123D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Constitutional reading dispensed (39-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Read second time","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Reading of substitute waived","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Committee substitute agreed to 23105123D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Engrossed by Senate - committee substitute SB1298S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-27","action":"Read third time and passed Senate (40-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Placed on Calendar","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Read first time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-08","action":"Referred to Committee on Commerce and Energy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-13","action":"Assigned sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-14","action":"Subcommittee recommends reporting (6-Y 1-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Reported from Commerce and Energy (21-Y 1-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-20","action":"Read second time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Read third time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"Passed House (97-Y 2-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-21","action":"VOTE: Passage (97-Y 2-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-24","action":"Enrolled","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-24","action":"Bill text as passed Senate and House (SB1298ER)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":765,"person_hash":"c4bu5qw8","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Creigh Deeds","first_name":"R.
