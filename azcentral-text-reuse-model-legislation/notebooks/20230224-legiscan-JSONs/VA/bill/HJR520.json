Provides that every person who meets the qualifications of voters set forth in the Constitution of Virginia shall have the fundamental right to vote in the Commonwealth and that such right shall not be abridged by law, except for persons who have been convicted of a felony and persons who have been adjudicated to lack the capacity to understand the act of voting. A person who has been convicted of a felony shall not be entitled to vote during any period of incarceration for such felony conviction, but upon release from incarceration for that felony conviction and without further action required of him, such person shall be invested with all political rights, including the right to vote. Currently, in order to be qualified to vote a person convicted of a felony must have his civil rights restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority. The amendment also provides that a person adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction as lacking the capacity to understand the act of voting shall not be entitled to vote during this period of incapacity until his capacity has been reestablished as prescribed by law. Currently, the Constitution of Virginia provides that a person who has been adjudicated to be mentally incompetent is not qualified to vote until his competency is reestablished.","pending_committee_id":156,"committee":{"committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102047D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":894,"person_hash":"y4inknoi","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Charniele Herring","first_name":"Charniele","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Herring","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-046","ftm_eid":5761539,"votesmart_id":110912,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":275445,"ballotpedia":"Charniele_Herring","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23033,"person_hash":"r5m6j4id","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Bennett-Parker","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Bennett-Parker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-045","ftm_eid":43746485,"votesmart_id":195975,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":772968,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Bennett-Parker","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
