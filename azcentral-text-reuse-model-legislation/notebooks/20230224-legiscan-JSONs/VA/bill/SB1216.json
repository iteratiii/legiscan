Requires TNC insurance to maintain the same minimum uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage as is currently required by law for all motor vehicle insurance policies of $30,000 for bodily injury per person, $60,000 for bodily injury per accident, and $20,000 for property damage, whether or not there is a passenger in the vehicle. The bill also prohibits TNC insurance underinsured motorist coverage from being set off by another policy from incidents arising when there is a passenger in the vehicle. Current law requires uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for TNCs at $1 million when a passenger is in the vehicle. The bill repeals expired provisions related to TNC insurance coverage.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":170,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Transportation"},{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102185D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Transportation","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Reported from Transportation (10-Y 3-N 1-A)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Constitutional reading dispensed (38-Y 0-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Read second time and engrossed","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Read third time and passed Senate (24-Y 14-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Placed on Calendar","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Read first time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Transportation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-14","action":"Reported from Transportation (22-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-16","action":"Read second time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Read third time","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"Passed House BLOCK VOTE (99-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-17","action":"VOTE: Block Vote Passage (99-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-22","action":"Enrolled","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-02-22","action":"Bill text as passed Senate and House (SB1216ER)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-22","action":"Signed by Speaker","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-23","action":"Signed by President","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":773,"person_hash":"7rn4k1kk","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Louise Lucas","first_name":"L.
