Directs the State Corporation Commission to conduct a proceeding for the purpose of establishing regulatory limitations on the authority of an investor-owned electric utility, natural gas utility, water utility, wastewater utility, or electric cooperative subject to regulation by the Commission to disconnect service to any customer for the nonpayment of bills or fees during a statewide emergency declared by the Governor in response to a widespread communicable disease of public health threat, during temperature weather extremes, or on a Friday, weekend, state holiday, or day immediately preceding a state holiday. The bill requires the Commission to ensure that such regulations are effective by November 1, 2023. The bill encourages certain utilities not subject to regulation by the Commission to adopt an internal operating policy to suspend service disconnections for nonpayment of bills or fees for 30 days in the case of a statewide emergency declared by the Governor in response to a widespread communicable disease of public health threat and to avoid disconnecting service to residential customers for nonpayment of bills or fees on a Friday, weekend, state holiday, or day immediately preceding a state holiday or during temperature weather extremes.","pending_committee_id":4570,"committee":{"committee_id":4570,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Commerce and
