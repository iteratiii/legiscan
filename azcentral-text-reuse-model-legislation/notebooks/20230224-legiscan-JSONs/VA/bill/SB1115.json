Provides preference for a bidder who is a resident of Virginia over a bidder who is a resident of any other state in determining the award for any contract for goods, services, or construction under the Virginia Public Procurement Act. The bill requires a state agency to decrease by seven percent the price of any offer for a Virginia end product, defined in the bill, and to decrease by two percent the price of any offer for a U.S. end product, defined in the bill, when evaluating bids for purposes of making an award determination. When the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, after price preferences have been taken into account, is a resident of Virginia and the offer price is within $10,000 or five percent, whichever is less, of the lowest responsive and responsible bidder who is a resident of another state, the Virginia resident shall be given the option to match the price of the nonresident bidder. Current allowance for granting price preferences to Virginia residents is made mandatory by the bill. The bill directs the Secretary of Commerce and Trade to convene a stakeholder work group to recommend revisions to the recyclable materials tax credit and report on the work group's recommendations by November 1, 2023. This bill is a recommendation of the Manufacturing Development Commission.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"General Laws and
