Requires the Virginia Employment Commission to establish and administer a paid family and medical leave program with benefits beginning January 1, 2025. Under the program, benefits are paid to eligible employees for family and medical leave. Funding for the program is provided through premiums assessed to employers and employees beginning in 2024. The amount of a benefit is 80 percent of the employee's average weekly wage, not to exceed 80 percent of the state weekly wage, which amount is required to be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the statewide average weekly wage. The measure caps the duration of paid leave at 12 weeks in any application year. The bill provides self-employed individuals the option of participating in the program.","pending_committee_id":161,"committee":{"committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor"},"referrals":[{"date":"2021-11-15","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor"},{"date":"2022-01-28","committee_id":4590,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor: Labor and Employment"},{"date":"2022-02-07","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and Labor"}],"history":[{"date":"2021-11-15","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
