The bill requires a managed care health insurance plan licensee to cover out-of-network mental health care services to a covered person if (a) the licensee does not have a mental health care provider within its network capable of providing mental health care services to the covered person; (b) the majority of the managed care health insurance plan licensee's mental health care providers within 25 miles of a covered person or, if appropriate for the covered person, available via telemedicine who have experience treating the general age group of a covered person are no longer accepting new patients or have wait-lists to receive care; or (c) the managed care health insurance plan licensee does not have a mental health care provider within 25 miles of a covered person or, if appropriate for the covered person, available via telemedicine who (1) has experience or expertise in treating patients who share the emotionally distressing experiences, defined in the bill, or demographics of the covered person seeking care and (2) is capable of providing care within the next 31 days. The bill provides that a licensee may require certain verification that the mental health care services are related to an emotionally distressing experience but is prohibited from requiring proof of a criminal proceeding. The bill requires a managed care health insurance plan licensee, for any covered person seeking mental health care services that has self-harm or suicidal ideation, to cover any associated out-of-network care such that the covered person shall not be responsible for any additional costs incurred by the managed care health insurance plan licensee for such services, other than any applicable copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. The bill requires a licensee to accept verification from the associated out-of-network provider that the mental health care services provided were related to the covered person's self-harm or suicidal ideation and prohibits a licensee from imposing any additional requirements to verify that the covered person was seeking care related to self-harm or suicidal ideation.","pending_committee_id":154,"committee":{"committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":3876,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #3"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23104222D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-31","action":"Assigned HWI sub: Subcommittee #3","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23033,"person_hash":"r5m6j4id","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Bennett-Parker","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Bennett-Parker","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-045","ftm_eid":43746485,"votesmart_id":195975,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":772968,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Bennett-Parker","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
