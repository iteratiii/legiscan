Authorizes the use of commercial delivery services with signed and dated acknowledgment of delivery by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry when providing notice to an employer of any proposed penalty for a violation of a safety or health provision or of the employer's failure to abate a violation of a safety or health provision. Under current law, the Commissioner is authorized to provide such required notices only through certified mail or personal service. The bill also requires the regulatory boards of the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation to send to any regulant subject to a disciplinary action notice in a manner that allows for confirmation of delivery. The bill removes the current requirement that such notice be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and retains the provision allowing delivery through electronic means, if agreed to by the parties.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and
