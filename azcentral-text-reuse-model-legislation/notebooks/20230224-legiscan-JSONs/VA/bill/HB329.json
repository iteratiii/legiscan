Requires that an agency prepare a detailed notice of intended regulatory action for any regulation that it plans to promulgate. The bill requires that prior to publication by the Registrar of Regulations, the notice of intended regulatory action be submitted to the Attorney General for a determination as to whether the agency has the explicit authority to promulgate the regulation as proposed in the notice of intended regulatory action. The bill requires the Attorney General to report the notice of intended regulatory action and its determination to the Governor for approval. Within 10 days after publication by the Registrar of a notice of intended regulatory action for a proposed regulation, either the chairman or vice-chairman of the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules may submit a written directive to the agency that prepared the notice for the agency to hold a preliminary public hearing and comment period on the notice of intended regulatory action. The bill prescribes requirements for the conduct of such public hearings on regulatory matters. The bill requires the Department of Planning and Budget to prepare an economic impact analysis of the proposed regulation that includes a qualitative analysis of the regulation and a detailed quantitative analysis of the impact of the regulation, which must include analysis of the implementation and compliance costs that are reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to the businesses, localities, and individuals that may be affected by the proposed regulation. The bill requires the Department of Planning and Budget to determine whether $10 million or more in implementation and compliance costs are reasonably expected to be incurred by or passed along to businesses, localities, and individuals over any two-year period as a result of the proposed regulation. After the Department of Planning and Budget submits an economic impact analysis for a proposed regulation to the legislature but before the agency submits the proposed regulation for final approval by the Governor, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules may request an independent economic impact analysis to be prepared by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission for the proposed regulation. The Department of Planning and Budget is required to provide a detailed explanation of any variance between estimates in the two economic impact analyses. If either economic impact analysis indicates $10 million or more in implementation and compliance costs, the bill requires the agency proposing the regulation to stop work on the proposed regulation until the regulation is modified to reduce its costs to below the $10 million threshold or a bill is enacted explicitly allowing the regulation to proceed.
