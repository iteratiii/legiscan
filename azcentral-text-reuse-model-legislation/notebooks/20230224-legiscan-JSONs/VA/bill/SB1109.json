The bill provides that the total value of reimbursement grants awarded to any school division annually shall not exceed an amount equal to $500 times the number of English language learner students in grades nine through 12 enrolled in such school division. The bill directs the Board to establish such guidelines as it deems necessary for the administration of the Program and to establish procedures for determining amounts and prioritizing the award of such reimbursement grants in the event that the moneys in the Fund are not sufficient to provide each school division the full grant amount for which they are qualified. Finally, the bill provides that reimbursement grants shall be awarded to eligible school divisions beginning with the 2023-2024 school year.
