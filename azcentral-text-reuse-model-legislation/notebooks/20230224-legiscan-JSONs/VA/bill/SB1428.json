Prohibits a common interest community association from conducting a foreclosure sale on a lien for unpaid assessments totaling less than $5,000, excluding interest and attorney fees. Current law does not place a limit on the amount of assessments that must be unpaid before a common interest community association may conduct a foreclosure sale on a lien for any such unpaid assessments. The bill also limits interest charged on such unpaid assessments to an annual rate of six percent and prohibits any bill to enforce a lien from being entertained upon such property if the assessments are less than $5,000. Current law prohibits any bill to enforce a lien from being entertained if such real estate is the judgment debtor's primary residence unless the judgment exceeds $25,000.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"General Laws and Technology"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103827D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on General Laws and Technology","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Committee substitute printed to LIS only 23104998D-S1","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Passed by indefinitely in General Laws and Technology with letter (12-Y 2-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":1477,"person_hash":"k252k3q4","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Scott Surovell","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Surovell","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-036","ftm_eid":5740451,"votesmart_id":115805,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":282953,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Surovell","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":189,"subject_name":"Civil Remedies and Procedure"},{"subject_id":268,"subject_name":"Property and Conveyances"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2635174,"date":"2023-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB1428\/id\/2635174","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1428+hil","text_size":88589,"text_hash":"2bfd4fb882e45571f2bb961857359d5a"},{"doc_id":2654627,"date":"2023-01-18","type":"Comm Sub","type_id":2,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB1428\/id\/2654627","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1428S1+hil","text_size":67852,"text_hash":"be1618e0d8fb349e360b0931e570066f"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1232956,"date":"2023-01-18","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in General Laws and Technology with letter (12-Y 2-N)","yea":12,"nay":2,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":14,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB1428\/id\/1232956","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S12V0041+SB1428"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":152100,"adopted":0,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"date":"2023-01-20","title":"Substitute for SB1428 for S-General Laws and Technology","description":"Substitute for SB1428 for S-General Laws and Technology","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/SB1428\/id\/152100","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23104998D.pdf","amendment_size":109306,"amendment_hash":"91c5c1209bbda59c916b6c226270fe7e"}],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":292013,"date":"2023-01-17","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103827D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB1428\/id\/292013","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB1428F122+PDF","supplement_size":57982,"supplement_hash":"5c7bd5955c0c4283a68b3586743c213f"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-18","time":"00:00","location":"Senate Room 3, Capitol","description":"Senate Committee on General Laws and Technology Hearing"}]}}
