Authorizes the governing body of any city to reduce the default speed limit on any highway maintained by the city that is located in a residence district to less than 25 miles per hour unless otherwise indicated by a sign and to adopt increased penalties for operation of a motor vehicle 15 miles per hour or more above the posted speed limit in a residence district. Current law authorizes the increased penalties in the Cities of Falls Church and Manassas.
