Additionally, the bill adds one project to place underground an electric distribution mainline as part of a transportation infrastructure improvement project incorporating transit that has been initially accepted for partial funding of at least $250 million pursuant to a federal program. The bill provides that such project is qualified to be placed underground if (i) the estimated additional cost of placing the proposed mainline, in whole or in part, underground does not exceed $40 million or, if greater than $40 million, the cost does not exceed 2.5 times the cost of placing the same line overhead, assuming accepted industry standards for undergrounding to ensure safety and reliability; if the public utility, the affected localities, and the Commission agree, a proposed underground line whose cost exceeds 2.5 times the cost of placing the line overhead may also be accepted into the pilot program and (ii) the public utility requests that the project be considered as a qualifying project under this section.
