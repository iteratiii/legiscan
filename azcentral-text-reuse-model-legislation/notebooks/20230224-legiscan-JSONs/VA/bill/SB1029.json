The bill requires the broadband service provider to give the railroad company written notice that meets certain requirements at least 30 days before the crossing date . The bill requires the broadband service provider to bear the cost of the crossing, to pay a fee of $2,500 for each crossing, and reimburse the railroad company for any actual flagging expenses associated with a crossing in addition to the standard crossing fee.

The bill requires the broadband service provider to bear the cost of the crossing, to pay a fee of $2,500 for each crossing, and reimburse the railroad company for any actual flagging expenses associated with a crossing in addition to the standard crossing fee. The bill provides that a railroad company may petition the State Corporation Commission if it asserts (a) the one-time standard cumulative crossing fee is not adequate compensation for the specified crossing, (b) the proposed crossing will cause undue hardship on the railroad company, or (c) the proposed crossing will create the imminent likelihood of danger to public health or safety. The bill provides that for a crossing over an abandoned section of track the standard cumulative crossing fee is $1,000 and that the railroad company does not have the opportunity to petition the Commission, unless the legally abandoned section of track was acquired by the railroad company during the five years prior to issuing a notice of crossing. The bill requires the broadband service provider to maintain a general liability insurance policy or railroad protective liability insurance policy that meets certain requirements. The bill requires the Commonwealth to grant a right-of-way to any broadband service provider seeking to use the right-of-way for broadband deployment to the extent that the Commonwealth owns any interest in any real property crossed by a railroad or manages any real property not owned by the Commonwealth that is crossed by a railroad.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-08","committee_id":161,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Commerce and
