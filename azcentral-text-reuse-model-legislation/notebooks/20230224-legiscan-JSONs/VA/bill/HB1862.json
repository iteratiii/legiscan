Provides that an elector who is selected by the state convention of any political party and who, at the convening of the electors after the election, refuses to present a ballot, presents an unmarked ballot, or presents a ballot marked in violation of his oath stating that he would, if elected, cast his ballot for the candidates for President and Vice President nominated by the party that selected the elector, or as the party may direct in the event of the death, withdrawal, or disqualification of the party nominee, is deemed to vacate the office of elector. The bill provides that the other electors present shall immediately fill such vacancy in the same manner as a vacancy due to an elector's death or failure or inability to attend. The bill applies the same provisions to electors who are named in a petition of qualified voters not constituting a political party. The bill contains technical amendments that consolidate into a single chapter the provisions of Title 24.2 relating to presidential electors.","pending_committee_id":156,"committee":{"committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},{"date":"2023-01-30","committee_id":3880,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100721D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-30","action":"Assigned P & E sub: Subcommittee #2","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-01","action":"Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":16261,"person_hash":"quifwl9y","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Richard Sullivan","first_name":"Richard","middle_name":"C.","last_name":"Sullivan","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"Rip","district":"HD-048","ftm_eid":5965912,"votesmart_id":129034,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":510361,"ballotpedia":"R.C._Sullivan_Jr.","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":215,"subject_name":"Elections"},{"subject_id":175239,"subject_name":"President or Vice President"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2631371,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1862\/id\/2631371","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1862+hil","text_size":22744,"text_hash":"af79133a1b4b4dc2570eecc3a91cdd6c"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1239464,"date":"2023-02-01","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","yea":5,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1862\/id\/1239464","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H1802V0011+HB1862"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":297955,"date":"2023-01-31","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100721D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1862\/id\/297955","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1862F122+PDF","supplement_size":59965,"supplement_hash":"5a8aee791e7c0ed73c792da6d60d6146"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-02-01","time":"07:00","location":"House Room 1","description":"House Privileges and Elections - Subcommittee #2 Committee Hearing"}]}}
