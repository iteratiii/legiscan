Removes the requirement that nurse practitioners, other than a nurse practitioner licensed by the Boards of Medicine and Nursing in the category of certified nurse midwife, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or clinical nurse specialist, who meet certain conditions may practice without a practice agreement only if they have completed the equivalent of at least five years of full-time clinical experience as a licensed nurse practitioner. The bill also removes patient care team requirements for nurse practitioners. The bill removes the existing provision allowing a physician to serve as a patient care team physician on a patient care team with up to 10 nurse practitioners licensed in the category of psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, thus limiting any patient care team physician to a patient care team with no more than six nurse practitioners.","pending_committee_id":154,"committee":{"committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3876,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions: Subcommittee #3"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and Institutions"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23100577D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-13","action":"Assigned HWI sub: Subcommittee #3","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Health, Welfare and Institutions","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":11025,"person_hash":"ny5zodq2","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Roxann Robinson","first_name":"Roxann","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Robinson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-027","ftm_eid":6699982,"votesmart_id":127380,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":295876,"ballotpedia":"Roxann_Robinson","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":267,"subject_name":"Professions and Occupations"},{"subject_id":169293,"subject_name":"Nurses"},{"subject_id":354905,"subject_name":"Practitioners"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2633867,"date":"2023-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB2183\/id\/2633867","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB2183+hil","text_size":21638,"text_hash":"e14600890696ba210cc0142f080f1e47"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1233159,"date":"2023-01-19","desc":"House: Subcommittee failed to recommend reporting (3-Y 3-N)","yea":3,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":6,"passed":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB2183\/id\/1233159","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H1203V0003+HB2183"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":151961,"adopted":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"date":"2023-01-19","title":"Substitute for HB2183 Health, Welfare and Institutions, Subcommittee #3","description":"Substitute for HB2183 Health, Welfare and Institutions, Subcommittee #3","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/HB2183\/id\/151961","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23104802D.pdf","amendment_size":23430,"amendment_hash":"8640da2b27b92a50a3640d3d5c6c6979"}],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-19","time":"09:30","location":"House Committee Room","description":"House Health, Welfare and Institutions - Subcommittee #3 Committee Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-26","time":"17:00","location":"House Room 2","description":"House Health, Welfare and Institutions - Subcommittee #3 Committee Hearing"}]}}
