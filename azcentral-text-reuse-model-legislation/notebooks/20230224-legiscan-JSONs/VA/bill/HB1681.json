Provides that if an individual is admitted to a skilled nursing facility for skilled nursing services and such individual was not screened but is subsequently determined to have been required to be screened prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility, then the screening may be conducted after admission. Under the bill, coverage of institutional long-term services and supports by the Commonwealth for such patients who have not been prescreened shall not begin until six months after the initial admission to the skilled nursing facility. During this six-month period, the nursing home in which the individual resides shall be responsible for all costs indicated for institutional long-term services and supports, without accessing the patient's funds. The bill provides that if sufficient evidence indicates that the admission without screening was of no fault of the skilled nursing facility, the Department of Medical Assistance Services shall begin coverage of institutional long-term services and supports immediately upon the completion of the functional screening indicating skilled nursing facility level of care pending the financial eligibility determination.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-09","committee_id":154,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Health, Welfare and
