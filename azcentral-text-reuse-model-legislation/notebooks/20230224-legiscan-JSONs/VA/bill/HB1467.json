Requires presentation of a form of identification containing a photograph in order to vote and provides that a voter who does not have one of the required forms of identification is entitled to cast a provisional ballot. The bill repeals a provision that would permit any person who is qualified to register to vote to do so in person up to and including the day of the election and limits the persons who are entitled to register to vote after the close of registration records to members of a uniformed service on active duty, persons who are residing temporarily outside of the United States, and their spouses and dependents. The bill limits the period during which absentee voting in person is available from 45 days preceding the date of the election to the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday immediately preceding the date of the election. The bill requires that absentee ballots returned by mail be returned to the office of the general registrar by the close of polls on election day and be postmarked on or before the Saturday preceding the date of the election. The bill eliminates the use of drop-off locations for the return of absentee ballots. The bill requires absentee ballot applications to contain the last four digits of the applicant's social security number and provides that the failure of an absentee ballot to include a witness signature is a material omission, rendering the ballot void.","pending_committee_id":156,"committee":{"committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-12-28","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"},{"date":"2023-01-12","committee_id":3879,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and Elections"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-12-28","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101089D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-12-28","action":"Referred to Committee on Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-12","action":"Assigned P & E sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (10-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Privileges and Elections","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21413,"person_hash":"ipnurrpv","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Scott Wyatt","first_name":"Scott","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Wyatt","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-097","ftm_eid":48309376,"votesmart_id":186781,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":714367,"ballotpedia":"Scott_Wyatt_(Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":215,"subject_name":"Elections"},{"subject_id":169232,"subject_name":"Voters and Voting"},{"subject_id":169251,"subject_name":"Absentee Ballots"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2620406,"date":"2022-12-28","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1467\/id\/2620406","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1467+hil","text_size":76577,"text_hash":"1d3843abae479100e1bd1414336cfa3d"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1234625,"date":"2023-01-24","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (10-Y 0-N)","yea":10,"nay":0,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":10,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1467\/id\/1234625","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H1801V0007+HB1467"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":293212,"date":"2023-01-20","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"House: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101089D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/HB1467\/id\/293212","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+HB1467F122+PDF","supplement_size":69522,"supplement_hash":"12fa3474d237e99b029f33a129c39d83"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-24","time":"07:00","location":"House Room 2","description":"House Privileges and Elections - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
