Allows a family member or descendant of a deceased person buried in a cemetery that is located on private property to petition the circuit court of the county or city where the property is located for interment rights upon such property. The bill provides that such family member or descendant may prove kinship to the court through official documentation or nonofficial documentation, such as obituaries, family Bibles or other documents with family signatures, journals or letters of the deceased person interred on the private property, family photographs, or other documentation deemed by the court to be reliable. The bill requires, upon satisfactory showing of proof of kinship, a private property owner to allow such family member or descendant, within two generations of immediate family descent, reasonable access to the property for the purpose of interment.","pending_committee_id":153,"committee":{"committee_id":153,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":153,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws"},{"date":"2023-01-18","committee_id":3870,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-01-31","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-02-01","committee_id":3862,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":153,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"General Laws"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
