Makes numerous changes to Taxation in the Commonwealth. Makes numerous changes to the Commonwealth's tax structure with the intention of eliminating the personal income tax. The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2025, all income tax rates shall be reduced by 1.15 percent each year that a tax reduction condition, defined in the bill, is met. Under the bill, tax rate reductions shall occur each year and shall be cumulative until reaching zero. The tax reduction condition would be met and the tax rate reduction would occur in any fiscal year that the amount of general fund revenues collected plus the amount of additional general fund revenues, defined in the bill, is greater than or equal to the amount of general fund appropriations made for such fiscal year plus the amount of revenue reduction that would result from a 1.15 percent reduction in the individual income tax rate. Additional general fund revenues are defined in the bill as general fund revenues that would be generated as a result of the tax policy changes resulting from the bill. The bill would increase the sales and use tax rate to 5.3 percent beginning July 1, 2024, and would increase this rate by one percent each year until reaching 9.3 percent beginning July 1, 2028. The bill would increase the tax on cigarettes by three cents per cigarette and would double the statutory tax rate on tobacco products, with the revenues from such taxes to be deposited in the general fund. The motor vehicle sales and use tax rate would be increased by one percent beginning July 1, 2024, and would increase by one percent each year until reaching an additional five percent over current rates beginning July 1, 2028. The motor fuels tax would also be increased by five cents per gallon beginning July 1, 2024, with additional five cents per gallon increases until reaching an additional 25 cents per gallon beginning July 1, 2028. The bill requires all additional revenue generated by such tax increases to be deposited in the general fund.
