The bill removes training requirements related to the possession and administration of naloxone. The bill directs the Department of Health, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, and the Department of Corrections to collaborate to develop a statewide comprehensive plan for the distribution of naloxone throughout the Commonwealth and allows such agencies to begin implementation of the plan to the extent the agencies are able to do so with existing resources.
