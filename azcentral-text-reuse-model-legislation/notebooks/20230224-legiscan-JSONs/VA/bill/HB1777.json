Establishes annual rate true-up (ART) reviews beginning no later than March 31, 2025, and annually thereafter, for rates, terms, and conditions for the provision of generation and distribution services by a Phase I Utility that has participated in triennial review proceedings in 2020 and 2023. The bill outlines requirements for the Commission in conducting ART reviews and limits the costs that are recoverable pursuant to a rate adjustment clause after January 1, 2025. The Commission is required to enter a final order following an ART review proceeding that determines the utility's costs and revenues and the revenue requirement for the utility to implement during the subsequent calendar year. The bill provides that the Commission may use any methodology it finds consistent with the public interest to determine the fair rate of return on common equity, subject to certain conditions in the bill. The bill removes the requirement for a Phase I Utility to file an integrated resource plan with the Commission.  Phase I Utilities; annual rate true-up reviews.
