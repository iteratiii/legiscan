Sets out the procedure by which, and clarifies the reasons for which, an elected officer or officer who has been appointed to fill an elective office may be removed from office. The bill requires, among other things, that the general registrar review the petition and determine its sufficiency in accordance with the uniform standards approved by the State Board of Elections and that the attorney for the Commonwealth review the petition to determine if valid grounds exist to remove the officer. If the attorney for the Commonwealth is the elected official who is subject to the removal petition, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia is tasked with appointing an alternate attorney for the Commonwealth.
