Authorizes the operator of a bicycle, electric personal assistive mobility device, electric power-assisted bicycle, or motorized skateboard or scooter to yield instead of stop at an intersection of two highways controlled by a stop sign if (i) each intersecting highway has no more than three motor vehicle travel lanes; (ii) the operator is at least 15 years old or accompanied by an adult; (iii) the operator slows to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions; (iv) before proceeding into the intersection, the person yields the right-of-way to any pedestrian lawfully within the crosswalk and to the driver of another vehicle approaching or entering such intersection from another direction; and (v) the stop sign is not marked as a full-stop stop sign. The bill authorizes the Department of Transportation to designate any stop sign as a full-stop stop sign if site-specific conditions, including limited sight distances and hidden entrances, make it unsafe for a person to yield instead of stop at such stop sign and requires a clearly marked sign at such stop signs.","pending_committee_id":159,"committee":{"committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3887,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation: Subcommittee #3"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102785D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Transportation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-13","action":"Assigned Transportation sub: Subcommittee #3 Highway Safety and Policy","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (4-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Transportation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":1478,"person_hash":"cnprvkye","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Betsy Carr","first_name":"Betsy","middle_name":"B.","last_name":"Carr","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-069","ftm_eid":6065415,"votesmart_id":111181,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":283103,"ballotpedia":"Betsy_Carr","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":254,"subject_name":"Motor Vehicles"},{"subject_id":169295,"subject_name":"Bicycles"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2630043,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB1773\/id\/2630043","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1773+hil","text_size":3111,"text_hash":"416544a35b85604bdbe55257afb509e4"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1235622,"date":"2023-01-25","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (4-Y 3-N)","yea":4,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":1,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB1773\/id\/1235622","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H1903V0010+HB1773"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":152615,"adopted":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"date":"2023-01-25","title":"Amendment(s) for HB1773 Transportation, Subcommittee #3 Highway Safety and Policy","description":"Amendment(s) for HB1773 Transportation, Subcommittee #3 Highway Safety and Policy","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/HB1773\/id\/152615","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23105524A.pdf","amendment_size":22172,"amendment_hash":"304cbb15fdc6c4318a9cc0df1e54fa17"}],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-25","time":"16:00","location":"6th Floor Speaker's Conference Room","description":"House Transportation - Subcommittee # 3 Highway Safety and Policy Committee Hearing"}]}}
