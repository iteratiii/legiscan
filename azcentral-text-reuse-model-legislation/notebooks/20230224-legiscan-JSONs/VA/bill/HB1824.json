Provides that each local school board shall adopt employment policies and practices designed to promote the employment of highly qualified teachers to effectively serve the educational needs of students who are English language learners, including providing financial support for teachers seeking and obtaining an endorsement in English as a second language pre-kindergarten through grade 12. The bill also establishes the English as a Second Language Incentive Reward Program and Fund for the purpose of awarding incentive grants to public school teachers in the Commonwealth who obtain an endorsement in English as a second language pre-kindergarten through grade 12. The bill provides that the Board of Education shall award to any teacher who obtains such endorsement an initial incentive grant of $5,000 and a subsequent incentive grant of $2,500 each year for the life of the endorsement, with such incentive grants to resume upon renewal of the endorsement. Finally, the bill directs the Board to establish such guidelines as it deems necessary for the administration of the Program and to establish procedures for the award of such incentive grants in the event that the moneys in the Fund are not sufficient to award each eligible teacher the appropriate award amount.","pending_committee_id":147,"committee":{"committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-01-17","committee_id":4572,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education: Early Childhood\/Innovation"},{"date":"2023-01-23","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"},{"date":"2023-01-24","committee_id":3849,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations: Elementary & Secondary Education"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":147,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Appropriations"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23102775D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-17","action":"Assigned Education sub: Early Childhood\/Innovation","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Subcommittee recommends reporting (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Subcommittee recommends referring to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Reported from Education (17-Y 4-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-23","action":"Referred to Committee on Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-24","action":"Assigned App. sub: Elementary & Secondary Education","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-25","action":"Subcommittee recommends laying on the table (8-Y 0-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Appropriations","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21412,"person_hash":"p44fto4a","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"John Avoli","first_name":"G.","middle_name":"","last_name":"Avoli","suffix":"","nickname":"John","district":"HD-020","ftm_eid":47299313,"votesmart_id":186412,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":702481,"ballotpedia":"John_Avoli","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19440,"person_hash":"yl6g82ws","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Elizabeth Guzman","first_name":"Elizabeth","middle_name":"R.","last_name":"Guzman","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-031","ftm_eid":43620466,"votesmart_id":176356,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620436,"ballotpedia":"Elizabeth_Guzman","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":19438,"person_hash":"o8mnos08","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Dawn Adams","first_name":"Dawn","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Adams","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-068","ftm_eid":43620496,"votesmart_id":176371,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":620470,"ballotpedia":"Dawn_Adams_(Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":3,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":23034,"person_hash":"4r2lyyzs","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Nadarius Clark","first_name":"Nadarius","middle_name":"E.","last_name":"Clark","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-079","ftm_eid":53400342,"votesmart_id":196001,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":773076,"ballotpedia":"Nadarius_Clark","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":4,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":890,"person_hash":"dndz7r74","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Kaye Kory","first_name":"L.
