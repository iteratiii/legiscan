The bill provides that a judge or jury may make a permissive inference that a person who is in possession of a catalytic converter that has been removed from a motor vehicle is presumed to have criminally obtained such catalytic converter unless the person is an authorized agent or employee acting in the performance of his official duties for a motor vehicle dealer, motor vehicle garage or repair shop, or salvage yard that is licensed or registered by the Commonwealth or a person who possesses vehicle registration documentation indicating that the catalytic converter in the person's possession is the result of a replacement of a catalytic converter from a vehicle registered in that person's
