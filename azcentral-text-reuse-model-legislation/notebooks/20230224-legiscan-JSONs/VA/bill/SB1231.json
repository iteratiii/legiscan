Removes the renewable energy requirement for each Phase I and Phase II Utility to retire all biomass-fired electric generating units that do not co-fire with coal by December 31, 2028. The bill provides that biomass-fired facilities may qualify as renewable energy standard eligible sources, provided that they meet certain requirements. The bill directs the Department of Forestry to convene an advisory panel to examine the use of forest-related materials, agricultural-related materials, and solid woody waste materials for biomass-fired electric generating units and to submit a report of the advisory panel's findings and any recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly no later than December 1, 2023. The bill also requires the Department to develop sustainable harvesting best management practices with respect to the utilization of forest-related materials, agricultural-related materials, and solid woody waste materials for biomass-fired electric generating units, including a lifecycle carbon analysis of all carbon emissions, including supply chain emissions, forgone sequestration, and the emissions from burning biomass for electricity generation.
