Provides that it is lawful for any physician licensed by the Board of Medicine to practice medicine and surgery to terminate or attempt to terminate a human pregnancy by performing an abortion or causing a miscarriage on any woman during the second trimester of pregnancy and prior to viability, defined in the bill as when the gestational age of the unborn child is (i) 24 weeks or more or (ii) in the estimation of the physician and two consulting physicians, at least 22 weeks, as long as the abortion is performed in a hospital. Under current law, abortion is lawful under such conditions prior to the third trimester of pregnancy. The bill abolishes lawful abortion during the third trimester of pregnancy, except to save the life of the mother. The bill also provides that regardless of the duration of the pregnancy, measures for life support shall be available and utilized when there is any evidence of viability of a child that has been completely delivered. The bill specifies that the provisions of abortion laws do not apply to the treatment of a nonviable pregnancy, as defined in the bill.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-18","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":3891,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Health Professions"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Presented and ordered printed 23103893D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-18","action":"Referred to Committee on Education and Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Assigned Education sub: Health Professions","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-26","action":"Passed by indefinitely in Education and Health (9-Y 6-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":17745,"person_hash":"r8ny1jji","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Siobhan Dunnavant","first_name":"Siobhan","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Dunnavant","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-012","ftm_eid":29336564,"votesmart_id":156456,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":533180,"ballotpedia":"Siobhan_Dunnavant","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0},{"people_id":767,"person_hash":"95brfq1d","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Emmett Hanger","first_name":"Emmett","middle_name":"W.","last_name":"Hanger","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-024","ftm_eid":6569535,"votesmart_id":8265,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":199406,"ballotpedia":"Emmett_Hanger","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":2,"sponsor_order":2,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":178,"subject_name":"Appropriations"},{"subject_id":206,"subject_name":"Crimes and Offenses Generally"},{"subject_id":169268,"subject_name":"Abortion"},{"subject_id":175759,"subject_name":"Pregnancy"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2650399,"date":"2023-01-18","type":"Introduced","type_id":1,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB1483\/id\/2650399","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1483+hil","text_size":36347,"text_hash":"6ecc74fde65bdfbd419a7e65884433b9"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1236105,"date":"2023-01-26","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Education and Health (9-Y 6-N)","yea":9,"nay":6,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB1483\/id\/1236105","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S04V0068+SB1483"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":292613,"date":"2023-01-19","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Presented and ordered printed 23103893D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB1483\/id\/292613","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB1483F160+PDF","supplement_size":36156,"supplement_hash":"50ba232f6587acf4301c579280c2ecff"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-20","time":"08:30","location":"Senate Subcommittee Room 2","description":"Senate Education and Health - Subcommittee Health Professions Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-26","time":"08:00","location":"Senate Room A","description":"Senate Committee on Education and Health Hearing"}]}}
