Makes it a Class 6 felony for any person to sell, offer for sale, or purchase a catalytic converter from a motor vehicle exhaust system that has been detached from a motor vehicle, except when such sale, offer for sale, or purchase is made to or by a scrap metal purchaser that has adhered to the required compliance provisions. The bill provides that a judge or jury may make a permissive inference that a person who is in possession of a catalytic converter that has been removed from a motor vehicle is presumed to have criminally obtained such catalytic converter unless the person is an authorized agent or employee acting in the performance of his official duties for a motor vehicle dealer, motor vehicle garage or repair shop, or salvage yard that is licensed or registered by the Commonwealth or a person who possesses vehicle registration documentation indicating that the catalytic converter in the person's possession is the result of a replacement of a catalytic converter from a vehicle registered in that person's name.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":4165,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Judiciary"},{"date":"2023-01-23","committee_id":164,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Finance
