The bill requires the addition of one member, to be appointed by the Governor, when there are an even number of members eligible to be appointed to the Commission. The bill provides that any locality is automatically excluded from the Commission if it fails to pay its proportionate share of the cost of participation by June 30, 2024. The bill repeals various provisions authorizing certain localities to join the Commission upon the terms and consent of the Commission. The bill requires the chairman position to rotate between the member localities annually beginning with a representative from the locality with the lowest population and continuing in order to the locality with the highest population. The bill provides a staggered schedule for original appointments of new members, requires the Cities of Hampton and Newport News to determine which one of the two members currently representing each locality will continue as members, and provides that the terms of the other members representing the Cities of Hampton and Newport News shall expire on July 1, 2023.","pending_committee_id":157,"committee":{"committee_id":157,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Rules"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":157,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Rules"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
