Provides for the removal of a general registrar by the circuit court upon a petition signed by a majority of the members of the State Board of Elections or a majority of the members of the local electoral board. Currently, a local electoral board may remove a general registrar with a majority vote, while the State Board of Elections may petition the circuit court to remove a general registrar only after petitioning the local electoral board to remove the registrar and the electoral board fails to do so. The bill requires the Virginia Division of Risk Management to assign counsel to the defense of any member of a local electoral board or general registrar subject to a petition for removal, upon that member's or registrar's application.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-20","committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and
