The bill allows the court, when an evaluation for temporary detention is recommended, to order the local community services board or behavioral health authority to conduct an evaluation of the defendant and, if the defendant meets the criteria for temporary detention, file a petition for a temporary detention order. The bill requires the community services board or behavioral health authority to notify the court, in writing, within 72 hours of the completion of the evaluation. In cases in which the defendant fails or refuses to appear for the evaluation, the bill requires the community services board or behavioral health authority to notify the court of such failure or refusal and requires the court to issue a mandatory examination order and capias directing the local primary law-enforcement agency to transport the defendant to the location designated by the community services board or behavioral health authority for examination. The bill repeals the sunset on the provisions of Chapter 508 of the Acts of Assembly of 2022, which also relate to competency and temporary detention evaluations.
