Requires TNC insurance to maintain the same minimum uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage as is currently required by law for all motor vehicle insurance policies of $30,000 for bodily injury per person, $60,000 for bodily injury per accident, and $20,000 for property damage, whether or not there is a passenger in the vehicle. The bill also prohibits TNC insurance underinsured motorist coverage from being set off by another policy from incidents arising when there is a passenger in the vehicle. Current law requires uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for TNCs at $1 million when a passenger is in the vehicle. The bill repeals expired provisions related to TNC insurance coverage.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-03","committee_id":159,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3885,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Transportation:
