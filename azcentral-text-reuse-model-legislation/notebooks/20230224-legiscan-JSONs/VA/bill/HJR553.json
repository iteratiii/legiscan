Repeals the constitutional provision defining marriage as only a union between one man and one woman as well as the related provisions that are no longer valid as a result of the United States Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015). The amendment provides that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of persons and requires the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions and agents to issue marriage licenses between two individuals, recognize marriages between two individuals, and treat all marriages between two individuals equally under the law, regardless of the sex or gender of the parties to the marriage. The amendment provides that religious organizations and clergy acting in their religious capacity have the right to refuse to perform any marriage.","pending_committee_id":156,"committee":{"committee_id":156,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Privileges and
