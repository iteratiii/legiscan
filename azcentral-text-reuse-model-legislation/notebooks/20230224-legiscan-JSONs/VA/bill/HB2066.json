Creates a rebuttable presumption that any statement of leniency made by a law-enforcement officer to a child prior to or during an interrogation was not made knowingly and voluntarily. The bill defines \"statement of leniency\" as any statement regarding (i) the types or number of charges; (ii) the length of custody; (iii) any condition of release; (iv) contact with such child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian; or (v) any other promise, condition, fact, or factor that a court finds to have swayed the will of the child. The bill provides that the Commonwealth may rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence that the statement was made knowingly and voluntarily.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2023-01-19","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2023-02-07","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23103945D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Assigned Courts sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-20","action":"Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-02-07","action":"Left in Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":23040,"person_hash":"bekkq5bg","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Jackie Glass","first_name":"Jackie","middle_name":"H.","last_name":"Glass","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-089","ftm_eid":0,"votesmart_id":201393,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":795351,"ballotpedia":"Jackie_Glass_(Virginia)","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":204,"subject_name":"Courts Not of Record"},{"subject_id":251,"subject_name":"Minors"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2632899,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB2066\/id\/2632899","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB2066+hil","text_size":3230,"text_hash":"10efb6c9e7782b9eba801a3b2d75f3ed"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1233917,"date":"2023-01-20","desc":"House: Subcommittee recommends passing by indefinitely (5-Y 3-N)","yea":5,"nay":3,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":8,"passed":1,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/HB2066\/id\/1233917","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+H0801V0102+HB2066"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":152159,"adopted":0,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"date":"2023-01-20","title":"Substitute for HB2066 Courts of Justice, Subcommittee #1","description":"Substitute for HB2066 Courts of Justice, Subcommittee #1","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/HB2066\/id\/152159","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23104999D.pdf","amendment_size":10848,"amendment_hash":"03e822ed4e96f2c7010ffed79261e714"}],"supplements":[],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-20","time":"00:00","location":"House Room 3","description":"House Courts of Justice - Subcommittee #1 Committee Hearing"}]}}
