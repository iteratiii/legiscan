Requires hospitals, nursing homes, and certified nursing facilities to allow patients to receive visits from clergy members during a declared public health emergency related to a communicable disease of public health threat. Under the bill, the hospital, nursing home, or certified nursing facility may require the clergy member to comply with all reasonable health and safety requirements and may restrict visits of a clergy member who fails a health screening measure or tests positive for a communicable disease of public health concern. If the health and safety requirement substantially burdens the clergy member's free exercise of religion, the hospital, nursing home, or certified nursing facility may require compliance only if the requirement furthers a compelling health and safety interest and imposes the least restrictive requirement. The bill provides immunity for hospitals, nursing homes, and certified nursing facilities and their employees and contractors from liability for injury or death due to exposure to a communicable disease of public health concern resulting from or related to such visitation, except in limited circumstances. The bill also allows a person or religious organization to bring a civil action against a hospital, nursing home, or certified nursing facility alleging a violation of such visitation provisions.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-06","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-01-13","committee_id":3890,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Health"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101768D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-06","action":"Referred to Committee on Education and Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-13","action":"Assigned Education sub: Health","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-19","action":"Passed by indefinitely in Education and Health (13-Y 2-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":679,"person_hash":"l6cddypu","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"John Cosgrove","first_name":"John","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Cosgrove","suffix":"Jr.","nickname":"","district":"SD-014","ftm_eid":5994307,"votesmart_id":50884,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":140549,"ballotpedia":"John_Cosgrove","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":231,"subject_name":"Health"},{"subject_id":175225,"subject_name":"Hospitals and Hospitalization"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2625368,"date":"2023-01-06","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB925\/id\/2625368","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB925+hil","text_size":32601,"text_hash":"36143d83ed4f55e8ab4ffe61116cdc85"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1233218,"date":"2023-01-19","desc":"Senate: Passed by indefinitely in Education and Health (13-Y 2-N)","yea":13,"nay":2,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":1,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB925\/id\/1233218","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S04V0018+SB0925"}],"amendments":[{"amendment_id":151781,"adopted":0,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"date":"2023-01-17","title":"Substitute for SB925 S-Education and Health, Health","description":"Substitute for SB925 S-Education and Health, Health","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/amendment\/SB925\/id\/151781","state_link":"https:\/\/committees.lis.virginia.gov\/pdfs\/drafts\/23104738D.pdf","amendment_size":50426,"amendment_hash":"62c07bcd6a3d8e19e0eeb8d95ac98756"}],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":290946,"date":"2023-01-13","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101768D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB925\/id\/290946","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB925F122+PDF","supplement_size":61063,"supplement_hash":"919c9d2b842311271ae25e0b94436da8"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-17","time":"16:00","location":"Senate Subcommittee Room 2","description":"Senate Education and Health - Subcommittee Health Hearing"},{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-19","time":"08:00","location":"Senate Room A","description":"Senate Committee on Education and Health Hearing"}]}}
