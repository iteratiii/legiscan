Requires that prior to any custodial interrogation of a child by a law-enforcement officer, the child and, if no attorney is present and if no exception to the requirement that the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian be notified applies, the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian shall be advised that (i) the child has a right to remain silent; (ii) any statement the child makes can and may be used against the child; (iii) the child has a right to an attorney and that one will be appointed for the child if the child is not represented and wants representation; and (iv) the child has a right to have his parent, guardian, custodian, or attorney present during any questioning. The bill states that if a child indicates in any manner and at any stage of questioning during a custodial interrogation that he does not wish to be questioned further, the law-enforcement officer shall cease questioning. The bill also requires, before admitting into evidence any statement made by a child during a custodial interrogation, that the court find that the child knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights and states that no admission or confession made by a child younger than 16 years of age during a custodial interrogation may be admitted into evidence unless it was made in the presence of the child's parent, guardian, custodian, or attorney.","pending_committee_id":150,"committee":{"committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-01-11","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"},{"date":"2022-01-25","committee_id":3861,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts: Subcommittee #1"},{"date":"2022-01-28","committee_id":150,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Courts of Justice"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/12\/22 22103084D","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-11","action":"Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":1},{"date":"2022-01-25","action":"Assigned Courts sub: Subcommittee #1","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-26","action":"Subcommittee recommends continuing to 2023 by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-01-28","action":"Continued to 2023 in Courts of Justice by voice vote","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0},{"date":"2022-11-22","action":"Left in Courts of Justice","chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":21453,"person_hash":"9jmp5nl2","party_id":"1","state_id":46,"party":"D","role_id":1,"role":"Rep","name":"Sally Hudson","first_name":"Sally","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Hudson","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"HD-057","ftm_eid":47299294,"votesmart_id":186397,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":702494,"ballotpedia":"Sally_Hudson","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[{"type_id":9,"type":"Carry Over","sast_bill_number":"HB622","sast_bill_id":1551728}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":204,"subject_name":"Courts Not of Record"},{"subject_id":251,"subject_name":"Minors"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2609607,"date":"2022-01-11","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/HB622\/id\/2609607","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB622+hil","text_size":3875,"text_hash":"9e3edf390c0023e34042443e9d5c2ca7"}],"votes":[],"amendments":[],"supplements":[],"calendar":[]}}
