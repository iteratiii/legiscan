Alters the notice requirements related to local government adoption of land use plans and zoning ordinances by no longer requiring the notice to contain a descriptive summary of the proposed action but continues to require the locality to identify in the notice the place or places within the locality where copies of the proposed plans, ordinances, or amendments may be examined. Furthermore, such notice must include the street address or tax map parcel number of the parcels as well as the approximate acreage subject to the action. With regard to notice of proposed zoning actions, the bill also (i) removes the requirement to state general usage and density of the proposed zoning action and (ii) eliminates the requirement for an extra public hearing when land is zoned to a more intensive use classification than was contained in the previous public notice.","pending_committee_id":149,"committee":{"committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"},"referrals":[{"date":"2022-12-30","committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"},{"date":"2023-01-11","committee_id":3856,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns: Subcommittee #2"},{"date":"2023-02-06","committee_id":149,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Counties, Cities and Towns"}],"history":[{"date":"2022-12-30","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
