Requires the Parole Board (the Board), prior to making any decision to grant discretionary parole to an inmate, to discuss and debate such decision at a meeting at which all Board members are present. The bill requires, in cases in which the Board grants discretionary parole to an inmate, each Board member to identify his reasoning for such decision at the time such member's vote is cast. The bill requires that parole review hearings include a live interview of the prisoner, which may be conducted in person or by videoconference or telephone, and, absent imminent death or other extraordinary circumstances, prohibits the Board from granting parole to any prisoner who has not received a live interview within the prior calendar year. The bill provides that final discharges may be issued by the Board only upon approval by a majority of Board members and requires the Board to publish an annual report regarding such final discharges, with items specified in the bill. The bill requires the Board to contact the victim of the crime for which the prisoner is incarcerated prior to making any decision to release the prisoner on discretionary parole and allows the victim to present testimony to the Board by virtual means. Under current law, the Board is required to endeavor diligently to contact the victim prior to making such decision.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":168,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Rehabilitation and Social Services"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101059D","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0},{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Referred to Committee on Rehabilitation and Social Services","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":1},{"date":"2023-01-20","action":"Failed to report (defeated) in Rehabilitation and Social Services (6-Y 9-N)","chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"importance":0}],"sponsors":[{"people_id":783,"person_hash":"3e7rj9m1","party_id":"2","state_id":46,"party":"R","role_id":2,"role":"Sen","name":"Mark Obenshain","first_name":"Mark","middle_name":"D.","last_name":"Obenshain","suffix":"","nickname":"","district":"SD-026","ftm_eid":5883443,"votesmart_id":50954,"opensecrets_id":"","knowwho_pid":219692,"ballotpedia":"Mark_Obenshain","bioguide_id":"","sponsor_type_id":1,"sponsor_order":1,"committee_sponsor":0,"committee_id":0,"state_federal":0}],"sasts":[],"subjects":[{"subject_id":266,"subject_name":"Prisons and Other Methods of Correction"},{"subject_id":169184,"subject_name":"Commissions Boards and Institutions Generally"},{"subject_id":175254,"subject_name":"Parole and Probation"}],"texts":[{"doc_id":2631444,"date":"2023-01-10","type":"Prefiled","type_id":11,"mime":"text\/html","mime_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/text\/SB1247\/id\/2631444","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1247+hil","text_size":15148,"text_hash":"0b838474eae087b6706ecd2d60ec1996"}],"votes":[{"roll_call_id":1233808,"date":"2023-01-20","desc":"Senate: Failed to report (defeated) in Rehabilitation and Social Services (6-Y 9-N)","yea":6,"nay":9,"nv":0,"absent":0,"total":15,"passed":0,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/rollcall\/SB1247\/id\/1233808","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+vot+S09V0025+SB1247"}],"amendments":[],"supplements":[{"supplement_id":291184,"date":"2023-01-14","type":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","type_id":3,"title":"Fiscal Note\/Analysis","description":"Senate: Prefiled and ordered printed; offered 01\/11\/23 23101059D","mime":"application\/pdf","mime_id":2,"url":"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/VA\/supplement\/SB1247\/id\/291184","state_link":"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?231+oth+SB1247F122+PDF","supplement_size":65358,"supplement_hash":"9698e0ec3ff6639e46adfc33e55c5b30"}],"calendar":[{"type_id":1,"type":"Hearing","date":"2023-01-20","time":"08:00","location":"Senate Room A","description":"Senate Committee on Rehabilitation and Social Services Hearing"}]}}
