Requires the Virginia Community College System (the System), in collaboration with the Board of Nursing, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), and representatives from for-profit and private not-for-profit institutions offering registered nursing (RN) degree or diploma programs, to standardize the core curriculum for all RN degree or diploma programs in the Commonwealth in name, content, rigor, and credits such that all classes and credits are stackable, transferrable, and universally accepted. The bill provides that such standardized RN core curriculum is to be called the Passport Nursing Program. The bill directs the System, in collaboration with the Board of Nursing, SCHEV, the Virginia Nurses Association, and other relevant stakeholders, to convene a work group, consisting of several representatives enumerated in the bill, to develop the Passport Nursing Program and the system by which all RN education and diploma programs offered in the Commonwealth will be standardized under the Passport Nursing Program. The bill directs the work group to (i) determine and define what classes constitute the RN core curriculum and (ii) develop a system to standardize such RN core curriculum in name, content, rigor, and credits to ensure that all credits earned toward an RN degree or diploma program are stackable, transferrable, and universally accepted across all such programs. The bill requires the work group to submit its report to the Governor, the Chairmen of the House Committee on Education and the Senate Committee on Education and Health, and the Board of Nursing by November 1, 2023.","pending_committee_id":0,"committee":[],"referrals":[{"date":"2023-01-10","committee_id":169,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Rules"},{"date":"2023-01-20","committee_id":163,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education and Health"},{"date":"2023-01-27","committee_id":3892,"chamber":"S","chamber_id":8,"name":"Education: Higher Education"},{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":151,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education"},{"date":"2023-02-10","committee_id":4573,"chamber":"H","chamber_id":7,"name":"Education: Higher Education"}],"history":[{"date":"2023-01-10","action":"Prefiled and ordered printed;
