G.  1.  Each school district board of education shall adopt

reserved for students of a different biological sex: 21

 STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

 

1st Session of the 59th Legislature (2023) 

 

HOUSE BILL 1947 By: McCall 

 

 

 

 

 

AS INTRODUCED 

 

An Act relating to state government; creating the 

Eliminate Economic Boycotts Act; declaring 

legislative intent; defining terms; requiring written 

verification in certain contracts; prohibiting 

interference in contracts; providing for enforcement; 

providing for noncodification; providing for 

codification; and providing an effective date. 

 

 

 

 

 

BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA: 

SECTION 1.     NEW LAW     A new section of law not to be 

codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows: 

A.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Eliminate 

Economic Boycotts Act". 

B.  The State of Oklahoma finds that: 

1.  Numerous essential American industries, including fossil 

fuel production, agriculture, timber production, and firearms, are 

being targeted for boycotting, divesting, and sanctioning by large 

corporations and public and private institutional investors;

24 

 2.  The goal of these colluding parties is to starve targeted 

legal industries of capital, restrict their productivity, and 

redirect that capital to favored industries; 

3.  These parties are working in concert with many state and 

federal lawmakers and regulators, as evidenced most recently by new 

climate disclosure rules from the United States Securities and 

Exchange Commission; 

4.  Restricting the supply of energy and other essential 

commodities, without effective substitutes for those commodities, 

only serves to raise prices on consumers, profoundly impacting the 

poorest among us; 

5.  Denying financing to American companies, who are among the 

most socially and environmentally responsible companies in the 

world, only serves to support hostile nations and less responsible 

producers; 

6.  Banks and insurance companies are increasingly denying 

financing to creditworthy companies to market their environmental 

credentials to the detriment of consumers, shareholders and society; 

7.  Institutional investors are divesting from entire industries 

and pressuring corporations to commit to environmental goals, such 

as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero (0) by 2050, to burnish 

their environmental credentials or promote their own environmental, 

social, and governance funds at the expense of investor returns;

 8.  Large investment firms, through their proxy votes on 

shareholder resolutions and board elections, are colluding to force 

companies to direct money, time, and attention away from their core 

responsibility of increasing shareholder returns, driving capital 

allocation decisions and political change outside the democratic 

process; 

9.  Corporations are boycotting and sanctioning essential legal 

industries, such as fossil fuel and agriculture producers, by 

denying them capital, refusing to provide them with products or 

services, or imposing undue burdens on them; 

10.  The collusion of corporations, and institutions to boycott, 

divest from, or sanction any industry may violate existing antitrust 

and fiduciary duty laws and harms consumers, shareholders, and this 

state; and 

11.  States, when financially prudent, should avoid doing 

business with companies that engage in such potentially illegal 

conduct, and threaten harm to this state, its businesses, and 

citizens. 

SECTION 2.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 583 of Title 74, unless there is 

created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

A.  As used in this section: 

1.  "Company" means a for-profit organization, association, 

corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited partnership,

 limited liability partnership, or limited liability company, 

including a wholly owned subsidiary, majority-owned subsidiary, 

parent company, or affiliate of those entities or business 

associations.  For the purposes of this section, "company" does not 

include sole proprietorships. 

2.  "Governmental entity" means a state agency or political 

subdivision of this state. 

3.  "Ordinary business purpose" does not include any purpose to 

further social, political, or ideological interests.  A company may 

reasonably be determined to have taken an action, or considered a 

factor, with a purpose to further social, political, or ideological 

interests based upon evidence indicating such a purpose, including, 

but not limited to: 

a. branding, advertising, statements, explanations, 

reports, letters to clients, communications with 

portfolio companies, statements of principles, or 

commitments, or 

b. participation in, affiliation with, or status as a 

signatory to, any coalition, initiative, joint 

statement of principles, or agreement. 

4.  "Economic boycott" means, without an ordinary business

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

institution of higher education or any higher education institution that is a member of the national 18 

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19 

national junior college athletic association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one of the 20 

following based on biological sex: 21 

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25 

students of the male sex. 26 

(ii) If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement 27 

that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: 28 

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; 29 

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and 30 

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup. 31 

16-112-3. Protection for educational institutions.   32

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6 

education. 7 

(b) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, institution 8

chapter to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or 10 

organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher 11 

education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any 12 

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15 

a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, 16

accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization. 18 

(d) All civil actions shall be initiated within two (2) years after the harm occurred. Persons 19

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

or pay for any medical procedure or service which violates his, her, 

or its conscience. 

B.  Limitations.  The exercise of the right of conscience is 

limited to conscience-based objections to a particular medical 

procedure or service.  This section may not be construed to waive or

criminally, or administratively liable for the exercise of 

conscience rights not to participate in a medical procedure or 

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted 

admitting privileges by the healthcare institution. 

D.  Discrimination.  No medical practitioner, healthcare 

institution, or healthcare payer shall be discriminated against in

right to make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting 

privilege decisions consistent with its religious beliefs.

C.  A licensing board may not reprimand, sanction, or revoke or 

threaten to revoke a license, certificate, or registration of a 

health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive 

activity protected under the First Amendment to the U.S. 

Constitution, unless the licensing board demonstrates beyond a 

reasonable doubt that the practitioner’s speech was the direct cause 

of physical harm to a person with whom the health care practitioner 

had a practitioner-patient relationship within the three (3) years 

immediately preceding the incident of physical harm. 

1.  The licensing board must provide a medical practitioner with 

any complaints it has received which may result in the revocation of

any medical practitioner, healthcare institution, or healthcare 

payer for any violation of any provision of this act.  Any 

additional burden or expense on another medical practitioner, 

healthcare institution, or healthcare payer arising from the 

exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any 

violation of this act.  However, no civil action may be brought 

against an individual who declines to use or purchase medical 

procedure or services from a specific medical practitioner, 

healthcare institution, or healthcare payer for exercising the 

rights granted in subsection A of Section 3 of this act. 

B.  Other Remedies.  Any party aggrieved by any violation of 

this act may commence a civil action and shall be entitled—upon the

damages sustained, along with the costs of the action and reasonable 

attorney fees.  Such damages shall be cumulative and in no way 

limited by any other remedies which may be available under any other 

federal, state, or municipal law.  A court considering such civil 

action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is 

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to his or 

her previous position, reinstatement of board certification, and re-

licensure of a healthcare institution or healthcare payer.

SECTION 2.   A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 158 IS CREATED TO 7 

READ AS FOLLOWS: 8 

(1) As it relates to public education, the General Assembly hereby finds and declares 9 

that: 10

(b) The least restrictive means available for the furthering of that compelling 15 

governmental interest. 16

following the receipt of the complaint or the basis for taking no action. 3 

(4) (a) After exhausting the complaint process established in subsection (3) of this 4

have occurred when members are sued by individuals, business 194 

entities, or governmental entities arising out of a parcel 195 

owner's appearance and presentation before a governmental entity 196 

on matters related to the homeowners' association. However, it 197

government. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that 202 

prohibiting such lawsuits by governmental entities, business 203 

entities, and individuals against parcel owners who address 204 

matters concerning their homeowners' association will preserve 205 

this fundamental state policy, preserve the constitutional 206 

rights of parcel owners, and assure the continuation of 207 

representative government in this state. It is the intent of the 208 

Legislature that such lawsuits be expeditiously disposed of by 209 

the courts. 210 

 (c)  A parcel owner sued by a governmental entity, business 211 

organization, or individual in violation of this section has a 212 

right to an expeditious resolution of a claim that the suit is 213 

in violation of this section. A parcel owner may petition the 214 

court for an order dismissing the action or granting final 215 

judgment in favor of that parcel owner. The petitioner may file 216 

a motion for summary judgment, together with supplemental 217 

affidavits, seeking a determination that the governmental 218 

entity's, business organization's, or individual's lawsuit has 219 

been brought in violation of this section. The governmental 220 

entity, business organization, or individual shall thereafter 221 

file its response and any supplemental affidavits. As soon as 222 

practicable, the court shall set a hearing on the petitioner's 223 

motion, which shall be held at the earliest possible time after 224

FIRST REGULAR SESSION

HOUSE BILL NO. 634
102ND GENERAL ASSEMBLY

INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE KELLEY (127).

0414H.02I DANA RADEMAN MILLER, Chief Clerk

AN ACT
To amend chapter 161, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to protections of

parental rights.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:

Section A. Chapter 161, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto one new section, to be
2 known as section 161.845, to read as follows:

161.845. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "Department", the department of elementary and secondary education;
3 (2) "Parent", a parent, guardian, or other person having control or custody of a
4 child;
5 (3) "School", a public school or charter school.
6 2. Before July 1, 2024, the department shall develop model procedures for
7 notifying a pupil's parent if there is a change in such pupil's services or monitoring
8 related to such pupil's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being and a school's
9 ability to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for such pupil. The

10 procedures shall reinforce the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions
11 regarding the upbringing and control of such parent's children by requiring school
12 personnel to encourage a pupil to discuss issues relating to such pupil's well-being with
13 such pupil's parent or to facilitate discussion of the issue with such parent. Such model
14 procedures shall not prohibit a pupil's parent from accessing any of such pupil's
15 education and health records that are created, maintained, or used by the school as
16 required by state law. For the 2024-25 school year and all subsequent school years, each
17 school shall adopt such model procedures.

EXPLANATION — Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.



18 3. No school shall adopt procedures or pupil support forms that prohibit school
19 personnel from notifying a pupil's parent about such pupil's mental, emotional, or
20 physical health or well-being, a change in related services or monitoring, or that
21 encourage or have the effect of encouraging a pupil to withhold such information from
22 the pupil's parent. No school personnel shall discourage or prohibit parental
23 notification of and involvement in critical decisions affecting a pupil's mental,
24 emotional, or physical health or well-being. This subsection shall not be construed to
25 prohibit a school from adopting procedures that permit school personnel to withhold
26 such information from a pupil's parent if a reasonably prudent person would believe
27 that disclosure would result in abuse or neglect as defined by state law.
28 4. No classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties relating to
29 sexual orientation or gender identity shall occur. This subsection shall not be construed
30 to prohibit voluntary counseling.
31 5. Pupil support services training developed or provided by a school to school
32 personnel shall adhere to pupil services guidelines, standards, and frameworks
33 established by the department.
34 6. At the beginning of each school year, each school shall notify a pupil's parent
35 of each health care service offered at such pupil's school and the option to withhold
36 consent for or decline any specific service. Parental consent to a health care service
37 under this subsection shall not be construed to waive the parent's right to access such
38 pupil's educational or health records or to be notified about a change in such pupil's
39 services or monitoring as provided by this section.
40 7. No school shall administer a well-being questionnaire or health screening
41 form to a pupil in kindergarten to grade three until after the school provides the
42 questionnaire or health screening form to the pupil's parent and obtains the permission
43 of the parent.
44 8. (1) Each school shall adopt procedures for a pupil's parent to notify the
45 principal, or such principal's designee, regarding concerns under this section at such
46 pupil's school. Such procedures shall contain the process for resolving such concerns
47 and shall require that, if such concerns remain unresolved fourteen calendar days after
48 such notification by the parent, the school shall immediately either resolve such
49 concerns or provide a statement of the reasons for not resolving such concerns. Each
50 school shall adopt policies to notify such pupil's parent of the procedures required under
51 this subsection.
52 (2) If a concern is not resolved by the school under subdivision (1) of this
53 subsection, a pupil's parent may:

HB 634 2



54 (a) Request the state board of education to appoint a neutral mediator from a list
55 maintained by the department. Any mediator on such list shall be a member of the
56 Missouri Bar in good standing and have at least five years of experience in
57 administrative law. The mediator shall determine facts relating to the dispute over
58 the school's procedure or practice, consider information provided by the school, and
59 render a recommended decision for resolution to the state board within fifteen days
60 after receipt of the parent's request for appointment of a mediator. The state board
61 shall approve or reject the recommended decision at its next regularly scheduled
62 meeting that is more than seven calendar days and no more than thirty days after the
63 date the recommended decision is transmitted to the state board or at a meeting called
64 by the state board president for the purpose of approving or rejecting such
65 recommended decision. The costs of the mediator shall be borne by the school. The
66 state board shall adopt rules and develop forms necessary to implement this paragraph;
67 or
68 (b) Bring an action against the school requesting a declaratory judgment that
69 the school procedure or practice violates this section and seeking appropriate injunctive
70 relief or actual damages, or both. A court may award damages and shall award
71 reasonable attorney's fees and court costs to a parent who receives declaratory or
72 injunctive relief.
73 (3) No provision of this subsection shall be construed to abridge or alter any
74 rights and remedies afforded by the general assembly or common law.
75 9. Before July 1, 2024, the department shall review and update, as necessary,
76 school counseling frameworks and standards; educator practices and professional
77 conduct principles; and any other pupil services personnel guidelines, standards, or
78 frameworks in accordance with the requirements of this section.
79 10. The department and the state board of education may promulgate all
80 necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this section. Any rule or
81 portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
82 authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is
83 subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
84 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
85 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to
86 disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
87 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2023, shall be
88 invalid and void.

A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to health care; to adopt the Medical Ethics1

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

 (a)  The liberty of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and 

mental health of that parent's child is a fundamental right. 

 (b)  This state, a political subdivision of this state, or another governmental entity 

shall not substantially burden the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing, 

education, health care, and mental health of that parent's child without demonstrating 

that the burden is required by a compelling governmental interest of the highest order as 

applied to the parent and the child and is the least restrictive means of furthering that 

compelling governmental interest. 

 36-8-104.  Parental rights and responsibilities. 

 (a)  All parental rights are exclusively reserved to a parent of a child without 

obstruction by or interference from this state, a political subdivision of this state, another 

governmental entity, or any other institution, including, without limitation, the following 

rights and responsibilities: 

 (1)  To direct the education of the child, including the right to choose

 (3)  To direct the upbringing of the child; 

 (4)  To direct the moral or religious training of the child;

subdivision of this state, another governmental entity, or any other institution 

suspects that abuse, neglect, or a criminal offense has been committed against 

the child by someone other than a parent, unless the incident has first been 

reported to law enforcement and notification of the parent would impede a law 

enforcement or department of children's services investigation. 

 (b)  This chapter does not: 

 (1)  Authorize or allow a parent to abuse or neglect a child; 

 (2)  Apply to a parental action or decision that would end life; or

withhold from a child's parent information that is relevant to the physical, emotional, or 

mental health of the child.  Engaging in conduct prohibited by this subsection (c) is

remedies provided to a parent under this chapter.

pronouns that do not align with the child's sex; and 

 (7)  Procedures by which a parent may learn about parental rights and

may adopt a policy to provide to parents the information required by this section in an 

electronic form. 

 (c)  Notwithstanding title 49, a parent shall submit a written or electronic request 

for information pursuant to this section to either the school principal or the director of 

schools.  Within ten (10) days of receiving the request for information, the school

parent or submit to the parent a written explanation of the reasons for the denial of the 

requested information.  If the request for information is denied or the parent does not

information, then the parent may submit a written request for the information to the local 

board of education or the governing body of a public charter school, which shall formally 

consider the request at the next scheduled public meeting of the board or governing 

body if the request can be properly noticed on the agenda.  If the request cannot be 

properly noticed on the agenda, the local board of education or the governing body of a

treatment, then this chapter shall not be construed to grant that child's parent an

unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter. 

 SECTION 2.  The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not 

constitute a part of the law enacted by this act.  However, the Tennessee Code Commission is 

requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act. 

 SECTION 3.  If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance 

is held invalid, then the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the act that 



 

 

 

 - 9 - 002241 

 

can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of 

this act are severable. 

 SECTION 4.  This act takes effect July 1, 2023, the public welfare requiring it.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6 

education. 7 

(b) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, institution 8 

of higher education, or athletic association or organization as a result of reporting a violation of this 9 

chapter to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or 10 

organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher 11 

education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any 12 

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15 

a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, 16

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

56TH LEGISLATURE - STATE OF NEW MEXICO - FIRST SESSION, 2023

INTRODUCED BY

Cathrynn N. Brown and Jenifer Jones and Harlan Vincent and

Andrea Reeb and Rod Montoya

A MEMORIAL

RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

BIOLOGICAL MALES AND FEMALES AND SUPPORTING THE REQUIREMENT

THAT SCHOOLS PROHIBIT BIOLOGICAL MALE PARTICIPATION ON FEMALE

ATHLETIC TEAMS.

WHEREAS, there are only two biological sexes:  male and

female; and

WHEREAS, a person's biological sex is determined at

fertilization and revealed in utero or at birth; and

WHEREAS, biological differences between males and females

are genetically determined; and

WHEREAS, characteristic anatomical differences and

distinct body types exist between males and females; and

WHEREAS, in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515

(1966), the United States supreme court explained that there

are "inherent differences between men and women" and these

differences "remain cause for celebration, but not for

denigration of members of either sex or for artificial

constraints on an individual's opportunity"; and

WHEREAS, males have typically scored higher than females

on tests of endurance, speed and strength, and males have

larger body sizes, more skeletal muscle mass, lower body fat

percentages and higher delivery of anaerobic and aerobic energy

than females; and

WHEREAS, males have higher natural levels of testosterone

than females, which result in higher speed and power during

physical activity.  This leads to a sports performance gap

between males and females; and

WHEREAS, courts have recognized that the inherent,

physiological differences between males and females result in

different athletic capabilities.  In Kleczek v. Rhode Island

Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992),

the Rhode Island supreme court recognized that "because of

innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not

similarly situated as they enter athletic competition".  In

Petrie v. Illinois High School Association, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861

(Ill. App. Ct. 1979), the Illinois court of appeals recognized

that "high school boys [generally possess physiological

advantages] over their girl counterparts" and that those

advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports,

WHEREAS, the benefits of natural testosterone provided to

male athletes are not diminished through the use of

testosterone suppression;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO that it be requested

to support maintaining separate sex-specific teams because such

separation promotes sex equality by providing opportunities for

female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength and

athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities

to obtain recognition, accolades, college scholarships and

numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in

athletic endeavors.

  (2)  To the extent that the minor suffered from a mental health 35 

concern, at least two (2) healthcare professionals, including at least one 36 



  SB199 

 

 4 2/6/2023 12:04:54 PM JLC038 

 

 

(1) mental health professional, certified in writing that the gender 1 

transition procedure was the only way to treat the mental health concern;  2 

  (3)  At least two (2) healthcare professionals, including at 3 

least one (1) mental health professional, certified in writing that the minor 4 

suffered from no other mental health concerns, including without limitation 5 

depression, eating disorders, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity 6 

disorder, intellectual disability, or psychotic disorders; and 7 

  (4)  The healthcare professional received the voluntary and 8 

informed consent of the parent or legal guardian of the minor and the minor 9 

as provided in subsection (b) of this section.  10 

 (b)  Consent to a gender transition procedure is voluntary and informed 11 

only if, at least thirty (30) days before the first treatment of the gender 12 

transition procedure and during every subsequent medical visit for treatment 13 

during the following six (6) months, the minor and the minor’s parent or 14 

legal guardian receives verbal notice and written notice in at least 14-15 

point, proportionally spaced typeface that state the following facts, 16 

verbatim: 17 

  "If your child begins one (1) of these treatments, it may 18 

actually worsen the discordance and thus increase the likelihood that your 19 

child will need additional and more serious interventions to address the 20 

worsening condition.  For example, if your child begins socially 21 

transitioning or taking puberty blockers, that treatment may significantly 22 

increase the likelihood that your child’s discordance will worsen and lead to 23 

your child eventually seeking cross-sex hormones or even surgery to remove 24 

some of your child’s body parts.  25 

  Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom have conducted systematic 26 

reviews of evidence and concluded that there is no evidence that the 27 

potential benefits of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for this 28 

purpose outweigh the known or assumed risks.  29 

  Medical authorities in Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom 30 

have since recommended psychotherapy as the first line of treatment for youth 31 

gender dysphoria, with drugs and surgeries reserved as a measure of last 32 

resort.  Medical authorities in France have advised “great caution” when 33 

prescribing hormones for gender dysphoria.  34 

  There are people who underwent gender transition treatments as 35 

minors and later regretted that decision and the physical harm that these 36 



  SB199 

 

 5 2/6/2023 12:04:54 PM JLC038 

 

 

treatments caused, and the total percentage of people who experience this 1 

regret is unknown.  Some estimate that the rate is below two percent (2%), 2 

but that estimate is based on studies done on adults who transitioned as 3 

adults or on minors who transitioned under highly restrictive and controlled 4 

conditions.  5 

  Sometimes gender transition treatments have been proposed as a 6 

way to reduce the chances of a minor committing suicide due to discordance 7 

between the minor’s sex and his or her perception, but the rates of actual 8 

suicide from this discordance remain extremely low.  Furthermore, as 9 

recognized by health authorities in Europe, there is no evidence that 10 

suicidality is caused by “unaffirmed” gender or that gender transition 11 

treatments are causally linked to a reduction in serious suicidal attempts or 12 

ideations.  13 

  For puberty blockers:  14 

  Puberty blockers are not approved for this purpose by the United 15 

States Food and Drug Administration, which is the federal agency that 16 

determines which drugs are safe and effective for humans to use.  Claims 17 

about puberty blockers’ safety and efficacy are based on their use for 18 

precocious puberty, a different condition in which normal puberty is allowed 19 

to resume once the patient reaches the appropriate age.  Studies on the 20 

benefits of using puberty blockers for gender dysphoria are notoriously weak.  21 

Puberty blockers are not fully reversible because, among other risks, puberty 22 

blockers may intensify a minor’s discordance and cause it to persist.  23 

Puberty blockers increase the risk of your child being sterilized, meaning 24 

that he or she will never be able to have children.  Puberty blockers may 25 

also cause diminished bone density for your child, increasing the risk of 26 

fracture and early osteoporosis.  Puberty blockers may also prevent your 27 

child from ever being able to engage in sexual activity or achieve orgasm for 28 

the rest of your child’s life.  There is no research on the long-term risks 29 

to minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers.  The full effects of 30 

puberty blockers on brain development and cognition are unknown.  31 

  For cross-sex hormones:  32 

  The use of cross-sex hormones in males is associated with 33 

numerous health risks, such as thromboembolic disease, including without 34 

limitation blood clots; cholelithiasis, including gallstones; coronary artery 35 

disease, including without limitation heart attacks; macroprolactinoma, which 36 



  SB199 

 

 6 2/6/2023 12:04:54 PM JLC038 

 

 

is a tumor of the pituitary gland; cerebrovascular disease, including without 1 

limitation strokes; hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of 2 

triglycerides in the blood; breast cancer; and irreversible infertility.   3 

The use of cross-sex hormones in females is associated with risks of 4 

erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; severe liver 5 

dysfunction; coronary artery disease, including without limitation heart 6 

attacks; hypertension; and increased risk of breast and uterine cancers.  7 

Once a minor begins cross-sex hormones, the minor may need to continue taking 8 

those hormones for many years and possibly for the remainder of the minor’s 9 

life.  The cost of these hormones may be tens of thousands of dollars.  If 10 

the use of cross-sex hormones leads to surgery, the total cost of 11 

transitioning may exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).  12 

  For surgical procedures:  13 

  The dangers, risks, complications, and long-term concerns 14 

associated with these types of procedures are almost entirely unknown.  There 15 

are no long-term studies on either the effectiveness or safety of these 16 

surgical procedures."  17 

 18 

 SECTION 2.  Arkansas Code Title 17, Chapter 80, Subchapter 1, is 19 

amended to add an additional section to read as follows: 20 

 17-80-122.  Preserving freedom of conscience and medical judgment for 21 

healthcare professionals. 22 

 State law shall not require, or be construed to require, a healthcare 23 

professional to perform a gender transition procedure. 24

     (3)  Present students with the latest medically factual  20

Pupils shall be encouraged to base their actions on  38

exploit another person.  Pupils shall be taught to resist  43

predators, including online predators when using electronic  50 

communication methods such as the internet, cell phones,  51

enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or the  58 

National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's  59 

CyberTipline; 60

The General Assembly finds that:12

(1)  There has been a massive unexplained rise in diagnoses of gender dysphoria among13

children over the past ten years, with most of those experiencing this phenomenon being14

girls;15



23 LC 33 9348

S. B. 140
- 2 -

(2)  Gender dysphoria is often comorbid with other mental health and developmental16

conditions, including autism spectrum disorder;17

(3)  A significant portion of children with gender dysphoria do not persist in their gender18

dysphoric conditions past early adulthood;19

(4)  Certain medical treatments for gender dysphoria, such as surgeries, have permanent20

and irreversible effects on children;21

(5)  No large-scale studies have tracked people who received gender-related medical care22

as children to determine how many remained satisfied with their treatment as they aged23

and how many eventually regretted transitioning; on the contrary, the General Assembly24

is aware of statistics showing a rising number of such individuals who, as adults, have25

regretted undergoing such treatment and the permanent physical harm it caused;26

(6)  Under the principle of "do no harm," taking a wait-and-see approach to minors with27

gender dysphoria, providing counseling, and allowing the child time to mature and28

develop his or her own identity is preferable to causing the child permanent physical29

damage; and30

(7)  The General Assembly has an obligation to protect children, whose brains and31

executive functioning are still developing, from undergoing unnecessary and irreversible32

medical treatment.33

SECTION 2.34

Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 31 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to35

regulation of hospitals and related institutions, is amended by adding a new Code section to36

read as follows:37

"31-7-3.5.38

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, no sex reassignment39

surgeries, or any other surgical procedures, that are performed for the purpose of altering40

primary or secondary sexual characteristics shall be performed on a minor for the treatment41

of gender dysphoria in an institution licensed pursuant to this article.42

(b)  The provisions of subsection (a) of this Code section shall not apply to treatment43

provided pursuant to an exception contained in subsection (b) of Code Section 43-34-15.44

(c)  The department shall establish sanctions, by rule and regulation, for violations of this45

Code section up to and including the revocation of an institution's permit issued pursuant46

to Code Section 31-7-3."47

SECTION 3.48

Article 1 of Chapter 34 of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to the49

Georgia Composite Medical Board, is amending by adding a new Code section to read as50

follows:51

"43-34-15.52

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, sex reassignment53

surgeries, or any other surgical procedures, that are for the purpose of altering primary or54

secondary sexual characteristics performed on a minor for the treatment of gender55

dysphoria are prohibited in this state.56

(b)  The board shall adopt rules and regulations regarding the prohibitions contained in57

subsection (a) of this Code section, which may contain limited exceptions for:58

(1)  Treatments for medical conditions other than gender dysphoria or for the purpose of59

sex reassignment where such treatments are deemed medically necessary; and60

(2)  Treatments for individuals born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex61

development, including individuals born with ambiguous genitalia or chromosomal62

abnormalities resulting in ambiguity regarding the individual's biological sex.63

(c)  A licensed physician who violates this Code section shall be held administratively64

accountable to the board for such violation  but shall not be held civilly liable for damages65

to any person in any civil or administrative action or criminally responsible for injury,66

shall not constitute medical necessity. 

B.  If a person received hormone therapy or a puberty blocking

the hormone therapy or puberty blocking drug, the person may bring 

an action against his or her parent or legal guardian who consented 

to the hormone therapy or puberty blocking drug on behalf of the 

minor. 

C.  If the person is under eighteen (18) years of age, he or she 

may bring an action: 

1.  Throughout their minority through a parent or legal 

guardian, provided that the parent or legal guardian is not the same 

parent or legal guardian who consented to hormone therapy or a 

puberty blocking drug on behalf of the minor; and 

2.  In their own name upon reaching majority. 

D.  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall 

be no time limitation for the commencement of an action brought 

under this section except as provided by this subsection.

A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to health care; to adopt the Medical Ethics1

and Diversity Act; and to provide severability.2

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-1-



Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

nurses, allied health professionals, paraprofessionals, or contractors or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-4-



employees of health care institutions;1

(7) Medical practitioner means any person or individual who may be2

or is asked to participate in any way in any health care service. The3

term includes, but is not limited to, doctors, nurse practitioners,4

physician's assistants, nurses, nurses' aides, allied health5

professionals, medical assistants, hospital employees, clinic employees,6

nursing home employees, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and employees,7

medical school faculty and students, nursing school faculty and students,8

psychology and counseling faculty and students, medical researchers,9

laboratory technicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, mental10

health professionals, social workers, or any other person who facilitates11

or participates in the provision of health care services to any person;12

(8) Participate in a health care service means to provide, perform,13

assist with, facilitate, direct, refer for, counsel for, advise with14

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

2023

2023

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

institution shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for11

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

 STATE OF OKLAHOMA 

 

1st Session of the 59th Legislature (2023) 

 

HOUSE BILL 2340 By: Lepak 

 

 

 

 

 

AS INTRODUCED 

 

An Act relating to government contracts; making 

legislative findings with respect to certain 

collusive activity; defining terms; prohibiting 

certain government entities from entering into 

certain contracts; specifying violative contractual 

provisions; providing exceptions; prohibiting certain 

actions with respect to financial institutions; 

authorizing enforcement of act; authorizing Attorney 

General to engage in discovery of information; 

providing for recovery of treble damages; providing 

for codification; and providing an effective date. 

 

 

 

 

 

BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA: 

SECTION 1.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 

in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 9301 of Title 74, unless there 

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

The Legislature finds that: 

1.  Numerous essential American industries—including fossil fuel 

production, agriculture, timber production, and firearms—are being 

targeted for boycotting, divesting, and sanctioning by large 

corporations and public and private institutional investors;

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

 2.  The goal of these colluding parties is to starve targeted 

legal industries of capital, restrict their productivity, and 

redirect that capital to favored industries; 

3.  These parties are working in concert with many state and 

federal lawmakers and regulators, as evidenced most recently by new 

climate disclosure rules from the United States Securities and 

Exchange Commission; 

4.  Restricting the supply of energy and other essential 

commodities, without effective substitutes for those commodities, 

only serves to raise prices on consumers, profoundly impacting the 

poorest among us; 

5.  Denying financing to American companies, who are among the 

most socially and environmentally responsible companies in the 

world, only serves to support hostile nations and less responsible 

producers; 

6. Banks and insurance companies are increasingly denying 

financing to creditworthy companies to market their environmental 

credentials to the detriment of consumers, shareholders and society; 

7.  Institutional investors are divesting from entire industries 

and pressuring corporations to commit to environmental goals, such 

as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, to burnish

requires immediate action, summary suspension of licensure or 

certification may be ordered before the filing of a sworn complaint 

or at any other time before the outcome of an individual proceeding.  

The summary suspension of licensure or certification may be ordered 

without compliance with the requirements of the Oklahoma Open 

Meeting Act.  Within seven (7) days after the summary suspension, 

the licensee shall be notified by letter that summary suspension has 

occurred.  The summary suspension letter shall include notice of the 

date of the proposed hearing to be held in accordance with Oklahoma 

Administrative Code 485:10-11-2 and the Administrative Procedures

of the Board indicate that the Board has not received any change of 

address since the order was sent, as required by the rules of the 

Board, the order and any subsequent material relating to the same 

matter sent to the most recent address on file with the Board shall 

be deemed by the court as having been legally served for all 

purposes.

82nd OREGON LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY--2023 Regular Session

House Bill 3137
Sponsored by Representative DIEHL

SUMMARY

The following summary is not prepared by the sponsors of the measure and is not a part of the body thereof subject
to consideration by the Legislative Assembly. It is an editor’s brief statement of the essential features of the
measure as introduced.

Prohibits medical health care professional from performing or providing sex alteration procedure
on minor. Defines “sex alteration procedure.” Provides that sex alteration procedure on minor is
unprofessional conduct subject to discipline by appropriate health professional licensing board. Al-
lows individual to bring claim for violation and recover specified damages.

Declares emergency, effective on passage.

A BILL FOR AN ACT

Relating to procedures to alter minor’s sex; and declaring an emergency.

Whereas Oregon has a compelling governmental interest in protecting the health and safety of

its residents, especially vulnerable children; and

Whereas only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress related to a

fixation on the reality of their sex; and

Whereas according to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to

0.014 percent of adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent of adult females; and

Whereas studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who experience

distress related to a fixation on the reality of their sex come to accept their sex in adolescence or

adulthood; and

Whereas scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress related to a fixation

on the reality of their sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these

individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services; and

Whereas suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities and mortality rates remain markedly elevated

above the background population after inpatient sex alteration procedures have been performed; and

Whereas some health care providers are prescribing drugs in order to delay the onset or

progression of normally timed puberty in children who experience distress related to a fixation on

the reality of their sex, despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks

and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress; and

Whereas health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who expe-

rience distress related to a fixation on the reality of their sex, despite the fact that no randomized

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in

adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress; and

Whereas the use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks, including, for females,

erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,

hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers and irreversible infertility, and for males,

thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular

disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer and irreversible infertility; and

Whereas genital and nongenital modification, amputation and mutilation surgeries are generally

not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to undergo such

surgeries are becoming more frequent; and

Whereas genital modification, amputation and mutilation surgeries include several irreversible

invasive procedures for both males and females and involve alterations of biologically normal and

functional body parts, including, for males, surgery that may involve genital mutilation including

penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty and vulvoplasty, and for females, surgery that

may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, genital mutilation in-

cluding metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty and implantation of erection or

testicular prostheses; and

Whereas the complications, risks and long-term care concerns associated with genital modifica-

tion, amputation and mutilation surgeries for both males and females are numerous and complex;

and

Whereas nongenital surgeries include various invasive procedures for males and females and

also involve the modification, amputation and mutilation of biologically normal and functional body

parts, including, for males, procedures such as augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization sur-

gery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair

reconstruction and other aesthetic procedures, and for females, procedures such as subcutaneous

mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants and other aesthetic procedures;

and

Whereas it is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or

product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases, and just between

2015 and 2016, sex alteration surgeries increased by 20 percent; and

Whereas it is of grave concern to Oregonians that the medical community is allowing individ-

uals who experience distress related to a fixation on the reality of their sex to be subject to irre-

versible and drastic nongenital surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital modification,

amputation and mutilation surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such

extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and

Whereas the risks of these procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study

on these procedures; now, therefore,

Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:

SECTION 1. As used in sections 2 to 4 of this 2023 Act:

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

employees of health care institutions;1

(7) Medical practitioner means any person or individual who may be2

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

institution shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for11

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

directly or indirectly perform, facilitate, or participate in an28

abortion, as defined in section 71-6901 unless the practitioner first29

affirmatively consents in writing to perform, facilitate, or participate30

in the abortion.31

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

Sec. 5.  (1) No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against5

in any manner because the medical practitioner:6

(a) Provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause7

to be provided to such practitioner's employer, the Attorney General, the8

charged with protecting health care rights of conscience, the Office for10

Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human11

Services, or any other federal agency charged with protecting health care12

rights of conscience information relating to any violation of, or any act13

or omission the medical practitioner reasonably believes to be a14

violation of, any provision of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act;15

(b) Testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning such16

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

(2) Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no20

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner because21

the medical practitioner disclosed any information that the medical22

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of27

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or28

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

a medical practitioner with any complaints it has received which may12

result in the revocation of the medical practitioner's license,13

certification, or registration within fourteen days after receipt of the14

complaint.15

(b) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or16

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must pay the17

medical practitioner an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars18

for each day the complaint is not provided to the medical practitioner19

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13 

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Fairness in Women's Sports Act". 14

sponsored by a public school or any public school district activities association or a public 17 

institution of higher education or any higher education institution that is a member of the national 18 

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19 

national junior college athletic association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one of the 20 

following based on biological sex: 21 

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25 

students of the male sex. 26 

(ii) If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement 27 

that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: 28 

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; 29 

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and 30 

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup. 31 

16-112-3. Protection for educational institutions.   32

or organization shall not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6 

education. 7 

(b) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, institution 8 

of higher education, or athletic association or organization as a result of reporting a violation of this 9 

chapter to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or 10 

organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher 11 

education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any 12 

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15 

a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, 16 

damages, and any other relief available under law against the government entity, licensing or 17 

accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization. 18 

(d) All civil actions shall be initiated within two (2) years after the harm occurred. Persons 19

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6 

education. 7

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

0670H.01I DANA RADEMAN MILLER, Chief Clerk

AN ACT
To amend chapter 163, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to participation in

athletic competitions.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:

Section A. Chapter 163, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto one new section, to be
2 known as section 163.048, to read as follows:

163.048. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "Athletics", any interscholastic athletic games, contests, programs, activities,
3 exhibitions, or other similar competitions organized and provided for students;
4 (2) "Sex", the two main categories of male and female into which individuals are
5 divided based on an individual's reproductive biology at birth and the individual's
6 genome.
7 2. (1) The general assembly hereby finds the following:
8 (a) A noticeable disparity continues between the athletics participation rates of
9 students who are male and students who are female;

10 (b) Courts have recognized a legitimate and important governmental interest in
11 redressing past discrimination against females in athletics on the basis of sex and
12 promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the sexes under Title IX of the
13 federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Section 1681 et seq.), as amended;
14 and
15 (c) Courts have recognized that classification by sex is the only feasible
16 classification to promote the governmental interest of providing opportunities for
17 athletics for females.

EXPLANATION — Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.



18 (2) The general assembly hereby declares that it is the public policy of this state
19 to further the governmental interest of ensuring that sufficient opportunities for
20 athletics remain available for females to remedy past discrimination on the basis of sex.
21 3. (1) Except as provided under subdivision (2) of this subsection, no school
22 district or charter school shall allow any student to compete in an athletics competition
23 that is designated for the biological sex opposite to the student's biological sex as
24 correctly stated on the student's official birth certificate as described in subsection 4 of
25 this section or, if the student's official birth certificate is unobtainable, another
26 government record.
27 (2) A school district or charter school may allow a female student to compete in
28 an athletics competition that is designated for male students if no corresponding
29 athletics competition designated for female students is offered or available.
30 4. For purposes of this section, a statement of a student's biological sex on the
31 student's official birth certificate or another government record shall be deemed to have
32 correctly stated the student's biological sex only if the statement was:
33 (1) Entered at or near the time of the student's birth; or
34 (2) Modified to correct any scrivener's error in the student's biological sex.
35 5. No school district or charter school that violates subdivision (1) of subsection 3
36 of this section shall receive any state aid under this chapter or any other revenues from
37 the state.
38 6. The department of elementary and secondary education shall promulgate all
39 necessary rules and regulations for the implementation and administration of this
40 section. Such rules and regulations shall ensure compliance with state and federal law
41 regarding the confidentiality of student medical information. Any rule or portion of a
42 rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority
43 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
44 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and
45 chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
46 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul
47 a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority
48 and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25 

students of the male sex. 26 

(ii) If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement 27 

that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: 28 

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; 29 

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and 30 

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup. 31 

16-112-3. Protection for educational institutions.   32

or organization shall not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6 

education. 7 

(b) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, institution 8

chapter to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or 10 

organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher 11 

education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any 12 

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15

accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization. 18 

(d) All civil actions shall be initiated within two (2) years after the harm occurred. Persons 19

chapter. 27

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

of, and access to, adult-oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, and 6 

general welfare of the citizens of this Commonwealth and to establish reasonable 7 

regulations to abate and prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult-8 

oriented businesses near sensitive land uses and locations that cater to minors. 9 

(2) It is not the purpose of Sections 1 to 6 of this Act to: 10 

(a) Impose a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access by 11 

adults to any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials, 12 

protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; 13 

(b) Deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented 14 

entertainment to their intended market; or 15 

(c) Condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 16 

(3) The General Assembly finds and declares: 17 

(a) Adult-oriented businesses, as a category of commercial use, are associated 18 

with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including crimes against 19 

persons and property, human trafficking, prostitution, potential spread of 20 

disease, lewdness, public indecency, vulgarity, weakening of public 21 

morality, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts 22 

on surrounding properties and their value, urban blight, litter, and sexual 23 

assault, trafficking, and exploitation; 24 

(b) Adult-oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to 25 

minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon these uses, and should 26 

be separated from other adult-oriented businesses to minimize the 27

secondary effects associated adult-oriented businesses and to prevent an 1 

unnecessary concentration of adult-oriented businesses in one (1) area; 2 

(c) Access to adult-oriented businesses should be limited exclusively to mentally 3 

competent adults; and 4 

(d) Each negative secondary effect described in this section constitutes a harm 5 

which the Commonwealth has a substantial government interest in 6 

preventing and abating. The Commonwealth's interest in regulating adult-7 

oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of both 8 

current and future adult-oriented businesses that may locate in the state. 9

Section 1. K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 21-6401 is hereby amended to read as 

follows: 21-6401. (a) Promoting obscenity is recklessly:
(1) Manufacturing,  mailing,  transmitting,  publishing,  distributing, 

presenting,  exhibiting  or  advertising  any  obscene  material  or  obscene 
device;

(2) possessing any obscene material or obscene device with intent to 
mail,  transmit,  publish,  distribute,  present,  exhibit  or  advertise  such 
material or device;

(3) offering  or  agreeing  to  manufacture,  mail,  transmit,  publish, 
distribute, present, exhibit or advertise any obscene material or obscene 
device; or

(4) producing,  presenting  or  directing  an  obscene  performance  or 
participating  in  a  portion  thereof which that is  obscene  or which that 
contributes to its obscenity.

(b) Promoting obscenity to minors is promoting obscenity, as defined 
in subsection (a),  where a recipient  of the obscene material  or  obscene 
device or a member of the audience of an obscene performance is a child 
under  the  age  of  18  years. As  used  in  this  subsection,  an  obscene

acts  which  constitute  promoting  obscenity  or  promoting  obscenity  to 
minors  shall  be  considered  a  conviction  of  promoting  obscenity  or 
promoting obscenity to minors for the purpose of determining the number 
of prior convictions and the classification of the crime under this section.

(d) Upon  any  conviction  of  promoting  obscenity  or  promoting 
obscenity  to  minors,  the  court  may require,  in  addition  to  any fine  or 
imprisonment  imposed,  that  the  defendant  enter  into  a  reasonable 
recognizance with good and sufficient surety, in such sum as the court may 
direct,  but  not  to  exceed  $50,000,  conditioned  that,  in  the  event  the 
defendant is convicted of a subsequent offense of promoting obscenity or 
promoting obscenity to minors within two years after such conviction, the 
defendant shall forfeit the recognizance.

(e) Evidence that materials or devices were promoted to emphasize 
their prurient appeal shall be relevant in determining the question of the 
obscenity  of  such  materials  or  devices.  There  shall  be  a  rebuttable 
presumption that a person promoting obscene materials or obscene devices 
did so knowingly or recklessly if:

(1) The  materials  or  devices  were  promoted  to  emphasize  their 
prurient appeal; or

(2) the  person  is  not  a  wholesaler  and  promotes  the  materials  or 
devices in the course of the person's business.

(f) As used in this section:
(1) Any material or performance is "obscene" if:
(A) The average person applying contemporary community standards 

would find that the material or performance, taken as a whole, appeals to 
the prurient interest;

(B) the average person applying contemporary community standards 
would  find  that  the  material  or  performance  has  patently  offensive 
representations or descriptions of:

(i) Ultimate  sexual  acts,  normal  or  perverted,  actual  or  simulated, 
including sexual intercourse or sodomy; or

(ii) masturbation, excretory functions, sadomasochistic abuse or lewd 
exhibition of the genitals; and

(C) taken as a whole, a reasonable person would find that the material 
or  performance  lacks  serious  literary,  educational,  artistic,  political  or 
scientific value;

(2) "drag performance" means a performance in which one or more 
performers:

(A) Exhibits a gender identity that is different from the performer's  
gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup or other accessories that  
are traditionally worn by members of and are meant to exaggerate the  
gender identity of the performer's opposite sex; and 

(B) sings,  lip-synchs,  dances  or  otherwise  performs  before  an

A BILL FOR AN ACT

Relating to parental rights regarding students.

Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:

SECTION 1. (1) A district school board may not adopt procedures that prohibit school

employees, contractors, agents or volunteers from notifying a student’s parent or guardian

about the student’s mental, emotional or physical health or well-being, or a change in related

services or monitoring, or that encourage or have the effect of encouraging a student to

withhold such information from a parent or guardian. School employees, contractors, agents

and volunteers may not discourage or prohibit parental notification of and involvement in

critical decisions affecting a student’s mental, emotional or physical health or well-being.

(2) Classroom instruction by school employees, contractors, agents and volunteers on

sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur without parental notification and con-

sent in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or devel-

opmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.

(3) Notwithstanding ORS 109.610, 109.640 and 109.675, a school district may not provide a

health care service to a student if the student’s parent has withheld consent to or declined

the specific health care service. At the beginning of the school year, each school district

shall notify a student’s parents of health care services offered at the student’s school and

the option to withhold consent or decline any specific service. Parental consent to a health

care service does not waive the parent’s right to access the student’s educational or health

records or to be notified about a change in the student’s services or monitoring as provided

by this section.

(4) Before administering a student well-being questionnaire or health screening form to

a student in kindergarten through grade 3, the school district must provide the questionnaire

contested case hearing to ensure that a parent’s concerns under this section are addressed.

The board’s rules must be as consistent as possible with the procedures applicable to a con-

tested case under ORS chapter 183.

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

physical harm.9

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6

organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher 11 

education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any 12 

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15 

a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, 16

accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization. 18 

(d) All civil actions shall be initiated within two (2) years after the harm occurred. Persons 19

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

SECTION 1.   A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 158 IS CREATED TO 3 

READ AS FOLLOWS: 4 

(1) As used in this section: 5 

(a) "External health care provider" means a provider of health or mental 6 

health services that is not employed by or contracted with the school district 7 

to provide services to the district's students; 8 

(b) "Health services" has the same meaning as in KRS 156.502; 9 

(c) "Mental health services" means services provided by a school-based mental 10 

health services provider as defined in KRS 158.4416; and 11 

(d) "Parent" means a person who has legal custody or control of the student 12 

such as a mother, father, or guardian. 13 

(2) Upon a student's enrollment and at the beginning of each school year, the district 14 

shall provide a notification to the student's parents listing each of the health 15 

services and mental health services available at the student's school and of the 16 

parents' right to withhold consent or decline any specific service. A parent's 17 

consent to a health service or mental health service shall not waive the parent's 18 

right to access the student's educational or health records held by the district or 19 

the notifications required under subsection (3) of this section. 20 

(3) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, as part of a school district's 21 

effort to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for students, a 22 

school shall notify a student's parents if: 23 

(a) The school changes the health services or mental health services provided to 24 

the student; or 25

provider. 1 

(4) School districts and district personnel shall respect the rights of parents to make 2 

decisions regarding the upbringing and control of the student through 3 

procedures encouraging students to discuss mental or physical health or life 4 

issues with their parents or through facilitating the discussion with their parents.  5 

(5) (a) The Kentucky Board of Education or the Kentucky Department of 6 

Education shall not require or recommend that a local school district keep 7 

any student information confidential from a student's parents. A district or 8 

school shall not adopt policies or procedures with the intent of keeping any 9 

student information confidential from parents. 10 

(b) The Kentucky Board of Education or the Kentucky Department of 11 

Education shall not require or recommend policies or procedures for the 12

sexuality or sexually transmitted diseases, instruction shall include but not be 5 

limited to the following content: 6

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13 

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Fairness in Women's Sports Act". 14

Interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports that are 16 

sponsored by a public school or any public school district activities association or a public 17 

institution of higher education or any higher education institution that is a member of the national 18 

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19 

national junior college athletic association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one of the 20 

following based on biological sex: 21 

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25 

students of the male sex. 26 

(ii) If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement 27 

that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: 28 

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; 29 

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and 30 

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup. 31 

16-112-3. Protection for educational institutions.   32 

A government entity, any licensing or accrediting organization, or any athletic association 33 

or organization shall not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

118TH CONGRESS 
1ST SESSION S. RES. 53 

Establishing a Women’s Bill of Rights to reaffirm legal protections afforded 

to women under Federal law. 

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 

FEBRUARY 9, 2023 

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH (for herself, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. CRUZ, Ms. LUMMIS, Mr. LEE, 

and Mrs. BRITT) submitted the following resolution; which was referred 

to the Committee on the Judiciary 

RESOLUTION 
Establishing a Women’s Bill of Rights to reaffirm legal 

protections afforded to women under Federal law. 

Whereas males and females possess unique and immutable bi-

ological differences that manifest prior to birth and in-

crease as they age and experience puberty; 

Whereas biological differences between the sexes mean that 

only females may get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed 

children; 

Whereas biological differences between the sexes mean that 

males are, on average, larger in size and possess greater 

body strength than females; 

Whereas biological differences between the sexes can expose 

females to more harm than males from specific forms of 

violence, including sexual violence;

•SRES 53 IS 

Whereas women have achieved inspirational and significant 

accomplishments in education, athletics, and employment; 

and 

Whereas recent misguided court rulings related to the defini-

tion of ‘‘sex’’ have led to endangerment of spaces and re-

sources dedicated to women, thereby necessitating clari-

fication of certain terms: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate reaffirms that— 1

(1) for the purposes of Federal law, the ‘‘sex’’ 2

of an individual means his or her biological sex (ei-3

ther male or female) at birth; 4

(2) for the purposes of Federal laws addressing 5

sex, the terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘girl’’ refer to human 6

females, and the terms ‘‘man’’ and ‘‘boy’’ refer to 7

human males; 8

(3) for the purposes of Federal law, the word 9

‘‘mother’’ means a parent of the female sex and ‘‘fa-10

ther’’ is defined as a parent of the male sex; 11

(4) there are important reasons to distinguish 12

between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, 13

domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and other 14

areas, particularly where biology, safety, and privacy 15

are implicated; 16

(5) policies and laws that distinguish between 17

the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional 18

scrutiny and permitted when they serve an impor-19

(6) for the purposes of complying with Federal 3

laws that require State and local government agen-4

such as Federal antidiscrimination laws, agencies 6

are required to base such data on the biological sex 7

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

Sec. 5.  (1) No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against5

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

complaint.15

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 28; 
Title 29; Title 33; Title 34; Title 36; Title 37; Title 
39; Title 40; Title 49; Title 56; Title 63; Title 68 and 
Title 71, relative to medical care of the young. 

 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE: 

SECTION 1.  Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 68, is amended by adding the following 

as a new chapter: 

68-33-101.  Findings. 

(a)  The legislature declares that it must take action to protect the health 

and welfare of minors. 

(b)  The legislature determines that medical procedures that alter a 

minor's hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, or otherwise change a 

minor's physical appearance are harmful to a minor when these medical 

procedures are performed for the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with, or 

live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex or treating purported 

discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted 

identity.  These procedures can lead to the minor becoming irreversibly sterile, 

having increased risk of disease and illness, or suffering from adverse and 

sometimes fatal psychological consequences.  Moreover, the legislature finds it 

likely that not all harmful effects associated with these types of medical 

procedures when performed on a minor are yet fully known, as many of these 

procedures, when performed on a minor for such purposes, are experimental in 

nature and not supported by high-quality, long-term medical studies. 



 

 

 

 - 2 - 000284 

 

(c)  The legislature determines that there is evidence that medical 

procedures that alter a minor's hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, 

or otherwise change a minor's physical appearance are not consistent with 

professional medical standards when the medical procedures are performed for 

the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity 

inconsistent with the minor's sex or treating purported discomfort or distress from 

a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity because a minor's 

discordance can be resolved by less invasive approaches that are likely to result 

in better outcomes for the minor.  

(d)  The legislature finds that medical procedures are being performed on 

and administered to minors in this state for such purposes, notwithstanding the 

risks and harms to the minors. 

(e)  The legislature finds that Dr. John Money, one of the earliest 

advocates for performing or administering such medical procedures on minors 

and a founder of the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, abused minors 

entrusted to his care, resulting in the suicides of David and Brian Reimer. 

(f)  The legislature finds that such medical procedures are being 

performed on and administered to minors in this state with rapidly increasing 

frequency and that supposed guidelines advocating such treatment have 

changed substantially in recent years. 

(g)  The legislature finds that minors lack the maturity to fully understand 

and appreciate the life-altering consequences of such procedures and that many 

individuals have expressed regret for medical procedures that were performed on 

or administered to them for such purposes when they were minors. 



 

 

 

 - 3 - 000284 

 

(h)  The legislature finds that many of the same pharmaceutical 

companies that contributed to the opioid epidemic have sought to profit from the 

administration of drugs to or use of devices on minors for such purposes and 

have paid consulting fees to physicians who then advocate for administration of 

drugs or use of devices for such purposes. 

(i)  The legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have 

sought to perform such surgeries on minors because the surgeries "make a lot of 

money" and "are huge money makers," not necessarily because the surgeries 

are in a minor's best interest. 

(j)  The legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have 

threatened employees for conscientiously objecting, for religious, moral, or 

ethical reasons, to performing or administering such medical procedures.  

(k)  The legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have 

posted pictures of naked minors online to advertise such surgeries. 

(l)  The legislature finds that Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and 

North Mississippi, an organization responsible for killing tens of thousands of 

unborn children, has become one of the largest administrators in this state of 

such medical procedures. 

(m)  The legislature declares that the integrity and public respect of the 

medical profession are significantly harmed by healthcare providers performing 

or administering such medical procedures on minors.  This state has a legitimate, 

substantial, and compelling interest in protecting minors from physical and 

emotional harm.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest 

in protecting the ability of minors to develop into adults who can create children 

of their own.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest in 



 

 

 

 - 4 - 000284 

 

promoting the dignity of minors.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and 

compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as 

they undergo puberty.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling 

interest in protecting the integrity of the medical profession, including by 

prohibiting medical procedures that are harmful, unethical, immoral, 

experimental, or unsupported by high-quality or long-term studies, or that might 

encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex. 

(n)  Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit medical 

procedures from being administered to or performed on minors when the 

purpose of the medical procedure is to:  

(1)  Enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity 

inconsistent with the minor's sex; or  

(2)  Treat purported discomfort or distress from a discordance 

between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

68-33-102.  Definitions. 

As used in this chapter: 

(1)  "Congenital defect" means a physical or chemical abnormality present 

in a minor that is inconsistent with the normal development of a human being of 

the minor's sex, including abnormalities caused by a medically verifiable disorder 

of sex development, but does not include gender dysphoria, gender identity 

disorder, gender incongruence, or any mental condition, disorder, disability, or 

abnormality; 

(2)  "Healthcare provider" means a healthcare professional, 

establishment, or facility licensed, registered, certified, or permitted pursuant to 

this title or title 63 and regulated under the authority of: 



 

 

 

 - 5 - 000284 

 

(A)  The department of health; 

(B)  An agency, board, council, or committee attached to the 

department of health; or 

(C)  The health facilities commission; 

(3)  "Medical procedure" includes, but is not limited to: 

(A)  Surgically removing, modifying, altering, or entering into 

tissues, cavities, or organs of a human being; or 

(B)  Prescribing, administering, or dispensing any drug or device 

to a human being; 

(4)  "Minor" means an individual under eighteen (18) years of age; 

(5)  "Parent" means any biological, legal, or adoptive parent or parents of 

the minor or any legal guardian of the minor; and 

(6)  "Sex" means a person's immutable characteristics of the reproductive 

system that define the individual as male or female, as determined by anatomy 

and genetics existing at the time of birth. 

68-33-103.  Prohibitions. 

(a)  A healthcare provider shall not perform or offer to perform on a minor, 

or administer or offer to administer to a minor, a medical procedure if the 

performance or administration of the procedure is for the purpose of: 

(1)  Enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported 

identity inconsistent with the minor's sex; or  

(2)  Treating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance 

between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

 (b)   



 

 

 

 - 6 - 000284 

 

(1)  It is not a violation of subsection (a) if a healthcare provider 

performs, or offers to perform, a medical procedure on or administers, or 

offers to administer, a medical procedure to a minor if: 

(A)  The performance or administration of the medical 

procedure is to treat a minor's congenital defect, disease, or 

physical injury; or 

(B)  The performance or administration of the medical 

procedure on the minor began prior to the effective date of this 

act.  

(2)  For purposes of subdivision (b)(1)(A), "disease" does not 

include gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, gender incongruence, 

or any mental condition, disorder, disability, or abnormality. 

(3)  For purposes of subdivision (b)(1)(B), the minor's treating 

physician must certify in writing that, in the physician's good-faith medical 

judgment, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time, 

ending the medical procedure would be harmful to the minor.  The 

certification must include the findings supporting the certification and must 

be made a part of the minor's medical record. 

(4)  The exception in subdivision (b)(1)(B) does not allow a 

healthcare provider to perform or administer a medical procedure that is 

different from the medical procedure performed prior to the effective date 

of this act when the sole purpose of the different medical procedure is to: 

(A)  Enable the minor to identify with, or live as, a 

purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex; or 



 

 

 

 - 7 - 000284 

 

(B)  Treat purported discomfort or distress from a 

discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

(5)  Nothing in subdivision (b)(1)(B) abrogates a minor's right to 

bring a cause of action against a healthcare provider or the minor's parent 

pursuant to § 68-33-104.  

 (c)  

(1)  It is not a defense to any legal liability incurred as the result of 

a violation of this section that the minor, or a parent of the minor, 

consented to the conduct that constituted the violation.  

(2)  This section supersedes any common law rule regarding a 

minor's ability to consent to a medical procedure that is performed or 

administered for the purpose of: 

(A)  Enabling the minor to identify with, or live as, a 

purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex; or  

(B)  Treating purported discomfort or distress from a 

discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

68-33-104.  Private Right of Action. 

 (a)   

(1)  Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (a)(3), a minor, or 

the parent of a minor, injured as a result of a violation of § 68-33-103, 

may bring a civil cause of action to recover compensatory damages, 

punitive damages, and reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and 

expenses. 

(2)  A minor injured as a result of a violation of § 68-33-103 may 

bring a civil cause of action pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) against the:  



 

 

 

 - 8 - 000284 

 

(A)  Healthcare provider alleged to have violated § 68-33-

103; and 

(B)  Minor's parent if the parent of the minor consented to 

the conduct that constituted the violation on behalf of the minor.  

This subdivision (a)(2)(B) supersedes any common law immunity 

granted to a parent.  If this subdivision (a)(2)(B) or its application 

to any person or circumstance is held invalid, then the invalidity 

does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that 

can be given effect without this subdivision (a)(2)(B) or 

application, and to that end, this subdivision (a)(2)(B) is severable. 

(3)  The parent of a minor injured as a result of a violation of § 68-

33-103 may bring a civil cause of action pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) 

against a healthcare provider alleged to have violated § 68-33-103.  The 

parent of a minor injured as a result of a violation of § 68-33-103 shall not 

bring a civil cause of action against a healthcare provider if the parent 

consented to the conduct that constituted the violation on behalf of the 

minor. 

(b)  The parent or next of kin of a minor may bring a wrongful death 

action, pursuant to title 20, chapter 5, part 1, against a healthcare provider 

alleged to have violated § 68-33-103, if the injured minor is deceased and: 

(1)  The minor's death is the result of the physical or emotional 

harm inflicted upon the minor by the violation; and 

(2)  The parent of the minor did not consent to the conduct that 

constituted the violation on behalf of the minor. 



 

 

 

 - 9 - 000284 

 

(c)  If a court in any civil action brought pursuant to this section finds that 

a healthcare provider knowingly violated § 68-33-103, then the court shall notify 

the appropriate regulatory authority and the attorney general and reporter by 

mailing a certified copy of the court's order to the regulatory authority and the 

attorney general and reporter.  Notification pursuant to this subsection (c) shall 

be made upon the judgment of the court being made final.  

(d)  For purposes of subsection (a), compensatory damages may include: 

(1)  Reasonable economic losses caused by the emotional, 

mental, or physical effects of the violation, including, but not limited to: 

(A)  The cost of counseling, hospitalization, and any other 

medical expenses connected with treating the harm caused by the 

violation; 

(B)  Any out-of-pocket costs of the minor paid to the 

healthcare provider for the prohibited medical procedure; and 

(C)  Loss of income caused by the violation; and

not limited to, psychological and emotional anguish. 

(e)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action commenced under 

this section must be brought: 

(1)  Within thirty (30) years from the date the minor reaches 

eighteen (18) years of age; or  

(2)  Within ten (10) years of the minor's death if the minor dies. 

(f)  This section is declared to be remedial in nature, and this section must 

be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.  

68-33-105.  Attorney General and Reporter's Right of Action. 



 

 

 

 - 10 - 000284 

 

(a)  The attorney general and reporter shall establish a process by which 

violations of § 68-33-103 may be reported. 

(b)  The attorney general and reporter may bring an action against a 

healthcare provider that knowingly violates § 68-33-103, within twenty (20) years 

of the violation, to enjoin further violations, to disgorge any profits received due to 

the medical procedure, and to recover a civil penalty of twenty-five thousand 

dollars ($25,000) per violation. 

(c)  A civil penalty collected pursuant to this section must be paid into the 

general fund of this state. 

(d)  The attorney general and reporter is entitled to reasonable attorney's 

fees, court costs, and expenses if the attorney general and reporter prevails in an 

action brought pursuant to this section. 

(e)  Jurisdiction for an action brought pursuant to this section is in the 

chancery or circuit court of Williamson County or circuit court in the county where 

the violation occurred.   

68-33-106.  Healthcare Provider Licensing Sanctions.  

A violation of § 68-33-103 constitutes a potential threat to public health, 

safety, and welfare and requires emergency action by an alleged violator's 

appropriate regulatory authority.  Upon receiving notification pursuant to § 68-33-

104(c), or upon otherwise becoming aware of an alleged violation of § 68-33-103, 

the appropriate regulatory authority shall proceed pursuant to title 63 or this title, 

as applicable.  

68-33-107.  Minor Immunity. 

A minor upon whom a medical procedure is performed or administered 

must not be held liable for violating § 68-33-103. 



 

 

 

 - 11 - 000284 

 

 SECTION 2.  Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 63-1-169, is amended by deleting the 

section. 

SECTION 3.  If any provision of this act, or its application to any person or circumstance 

is held invalid, then the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this act that 

can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of 

this act are severable. 

SECTION 4.  The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not 

constitute a part of the law enacted by this act.  However, the Tennessee Code Commission is

SECTION 1.   A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 405 IS CREATED TO 3 

READ AS FOLLOWS: 4 

(1) As used in this section: 5 

(a) "Child" means any person who has not reached the age of eighteen (18) 6 

years that has not been emancipated under law; and 7 

(b) "Parent" means a biological parent of a child, an adoptive parent of a 8 

child, or an individual who has been granted legal authority over the 9 

welfare of a child under this state's laws, but shall not include any 10 

governmental entity, organization, or any person whose authority over the 11 

child has been terminated by court order. 12 

(2) The liberty of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, healthcare, and 13 

mental healthcare of that parent's child is a fundamental right. 14 

(3) The state, any political subdivision of the state, or any other governmental entity 15 

shall not substantially burden the fundamental right of a parent to direct the 16 

upbringing, education, healthcare, and mental healthcare of that parent's child 17 

without demonstrating that the substantial burden is required by a compelling 18 

governmental interest of the highest order as applied to the parent and the child 19 

and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest. 20 

(4) All parental rights are exclusively reserved to a parent of a child without 21 

obstruction by or interference from the state, any political subdivision of the state, 22 

or any other governmental entity, including, without limitation, the following 23 

rights and responsibilities: 24 

(a) To direct the upbringing of the child; 25 

(b) To direct the moral and religious upbringing of the child; 26 

(c) To direct the education of the child, including but not limited to the right to 27

choose public, private, religious, or home schools, and the following rights 1 

as applied toward the public schools of the state: 2 

1. To make reasonable choices for the child's education as may be 3 

permitted and set forth in other statutes within public schools; and 4 

2. To access and review all school records relating to the child as set 5 

forth in the Kentucky Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, KRS 6 

160.700 to 160.730, unless prohibited by court order; 7 

(d) To consent in writing to all physical and mental healthcare decisions for the 8 

child through specific or general authorizations; 9

(f) To consent in writing before biometric data of the child is collected, shared, 11 

or stored, except for general identification cards or documents; 12 

(g) To consent in writing before any record of the child's blood or 13 

deoxyribonucleic acid is created, stored, or shared, unless authorized 14 

pursuant to a court order or collected as evidence to identify a person; 15 

(h) To consent in writing before any government entity makes a video or voice 16 

recording of the child, unless the video or voice recording is made during or 17 

as a part of: 18 

1. A public event; 19 

2. A court proceeding; 20 

3. A forensic interview in a criminal or Cabinet for Health and Family 21 

Services investigation; 22

that abuse, neglect, or any criminal offense, excluding de minimis offenses, 1 

has been committed against the child by someone other than a parent, 2 

including the right to be notified if the child has been a victim of a felony as 3 

set forth in KRS 158.156, unless the incident has first been reported to law 4 

enforcement and notification of the parent would impede a law enforcement 5 

or Cabinet for Health and Family Services investigation. 6 

(5) Nothing in this section shall authorize or allow a parent to abuse or neglect a 7 

child as defined in KRS Chapter 508 or 600.020. This section does not apply to a 8 

parental action or decision that would end the life of the child or to KRS Chapter 9 

402 relating to child marriage. This section shall not prohibit a court from 10 

issuing an order that is otherwise permitted by law. 11 

(6) No employee of this state, any political subdivision of this state, any other 12 

governmental entity, or any public or private educational institution, except for 13 

law enforcement personnel who are acting in an official capacity, shall 14 

encourage or coerce a child to withhold information that is vital to a parent's 15 

ability to exercise parental rights from the child's parents, nor shall any such 16 

employee withhold from the parent information vital to maintaining the physical, 17 

emotional, or mental health of the child. This shall include information necessary 18 

for the parent to engage at the earliest stages of problem behavior. 19 

(7) Unless those rights have been legally waived or legally terminated, parents have 20 

inalienable rights that are more comprehensive than those listed in Sections 1 to 21 

4 of this Act. The protections of the fundamental right of parents to direct the 22 

upbringing, education, healthcare, and mental healthcare of their child afforded 23 

by Sections 1 to 4 of this Act are in addition to the protections provided under 24 

federal law, state law, and the state and federal constitutions. 25

without the consent of the parent or legal guardian, including inducing of an 1 

abortion, prescribing any medication or performing any surgical procedure 2 

related to gender transition, or performance of a sterilization operation.[ In any 3 

such case, the physician shall incur no civil or criminal liability by reason of having 4 

made such diagnostic examination or rendered such treatment, but such immunity 5 

shall not apply to any negligent acts or omissions.] 6 

(2)[ Any physician may provide outpatient mental health counseling to any child age 7 

sixteen (16) or older upon request of such child without the consent of a parent, 8 

parents, or guardian of such child. 9 

(3)] Any qualified mental health professional, as defined by KRS 202A.011, may 10 

provide outpatient mental health counseling to any child who is age sixteen (16) or 11 

older and is an unaccompanied youth, as defined by 42 U.S.C. sec. 11434a(6), upon 12

unaccompanied youth. 15

which consent may be otherwise obtained or is not required, any emancipated 17 

minor or any minor who has contracted a lawful marriage or borne a child may give 18 

consent to the furnishing of hospital, medical, dental, or surgical care to his or her 19 

child or himself or herself and such consent shall not be subject to disaffirmance 20

emancipated minor shall not be necessary in order to authorize such care. For the 22 

purpose of this section only, a subsequent judgment of annulment of marriage or 23 

judgment of divorce shall not deprive the minor of his or her adult status once 24 

obtained. The provider of care may look only to the minor or spouse for payment 25

after a reasonably diligent effort; or 8 

(b) Based in good faith with a reasonable belief supported by fact that the 9 

minor is a victim of physical, sexual, or substance abuse by a parent or 10 

guardian and that obtaining a parent's or guardian's consent would place 11 

the minor at risk of further abuse from a parent or guardian[, the risk to the 12 

minor's life or health is of such a nature that treatment should be given 13 

without delay and the requirement of consent would result in delay or denial 14 

of treatment. 15 

(6) The consent of a minor who represents that he or she may give effective consent for 16 

the purpose of receiving medical, dental, or other health services but who may not 17 

in fact do so, shall be deemed effective without the consent of the minor's parent or 18 

legal guardian, if the person rendering the service relied in good faith upon the 19 

representations of the minor]. 20 

(5)[(7)] The consent of a minor age sixteen (16) or older who represents that he or she 21 

may give effective consent for the purpose of receiving outpatient mental health 22 

counseling from a qualified mental health professional, but who may not in fact do 23 

so, shall be deemed effective without the consent of the minor's parent or legal 24 

guardian if the person rendering the service relied in good faith upon the 25 

representations of the minor after a reasonable attempt to obtain parental consent or 26 

to verify the minor's age and status as an unaccompanied youth. 27

(6)[(8)] The professional may inform the parent or legal guardian of the minor patient 1 

of any treatment given or needed where, in the judgment of the professional, 2 

informing the parent or guardian would benefit the health of the minor patient. 3 

(7)[(9)] Except as otherwise provided in this section, parents, the Cabinet for Health 4 

and Family Services, or any other custodian or guardian of a minor shall not be 5 

financially responsible for services rendered under this section unless they are 6 

essential for the preservation of the health of the minor. 7 

Section 7.   Due to the high importance of parents' ability to exercise the rights 8 

outlined in this Act to provide the upbringing of their children in the Commonwealth, an 9 

emergency is declared to exist, and this Act shall take effect upon its passage and 10 

approval by the Governor or upon its otherwise becoming law. 11

The bill prohibits state money from being used to further certain
social, political, or ideological interests beyond what controlling state and
federal law require. Sections 1 to 3 of the bill apply this prohibition to the
public employees' retirement association (PERA) by requiring PERA to
make investments solely on financial factors and prohibiting PERA from
investing in an entity with a stated purpose to further certain social,
political, or ideological interests beyond what federal and state law
require (nonfinancial commitment). Section 1 also:

! Requires that PERA ensure that a designated agent
commits to following guidelines that match PERA's
obligation to act solely on financial factors prior to PERA
entrusting member funds to the designated agent;

! Requires that a designated agent ensure that a proxy
advisor or other service provider has committed to
following guidelines that match PERA's obligation to act
solely on financial factors prior to the designated agent
following a recommendation of the proxy advisor or
service provider; and

! Gives the attorney general the authority to enforce these
investment requirements.

Section 2 requires PERA to invest solely in the financial interest
of PERA members and beneficiaries. Section 3 clarifies that the fiduciary
duties of PERA's board of trustees include the obligation to act in the
financial interest of PERA members and benefit recipients.

Section 4 requires a government contract to include a verification
that a company entering into a government contract does not, and will not
during the term of the contract, engage in an economic boycott of another
company to further certain social, political, or ideological interests.
Section 4 prohibits a person from penalizing a financial institution for
complying with the non-economic boycott verification requirement.
Section 4 also gives the attorney general the authority to enforce the
newly created article.

Section 5 requires the state treasurer to make investments solely
on financial factors, prohibits the state treasurer from investing in entities
with a stated nonfinancial commitment, and gives the attorney general
authority to enforce these investment requirements.

Sections 6 to 10 make conforming amendments.

Fair Dismissal Act of 1983, § 6-17-1501 et seq., and the Public School 22 

Employee Fair Hearing Act, § 6-17-1701 et seq.; that these provisions of law 23

HOUSE BILL 1 

By Lamberth 

 

 

HB0001 
000284 

- 1 - 

 
 

AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 28; 
Title 29; Title 33; Title 34; Title 36; Title 37; Title 
39; Title 40; Title 49; Title 56; Title 63; Title 68 and 
Title 71, relative to medical care of the young. 

 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE: 

SECTION 1.  Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 68, is amended by adding the following 

as a new chapter: 

68-33-101.  Findings. 

(a)  The legislature declares that it must take action to protect the health 

and welfare of minors. 

(b)  The legislature determines that medical procedures that alter a 

minor's hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, or otherwise change a 

minor's physical appearance are harmful to a minor when these medical 

procedures are performed for the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with, or 

live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex or treating purported 

discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted 

identity.  These procedures can lead to the minor becoming irreversibly sterile, 

having increased risk of disease and illness, or suffering from adverse and 

sometimes fatal psychological consequences.  Moreover, the legislature finds it 

likely that not all harmful effects associated with these types of medical 

procedures when performed on a minor are yet fully known, as many of these 

procedures, when performed on a minor for such purposes, are experimental in 

nature and not supported by high-quality, long-term medical studies. 



 

 

 

 - 2 - 000284 

 

(c)  The legislature determines that there is evidence that medical 

procedures that alter a minor's hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, 

or otherwise change a minor's physical appearance are not consistent with 

professional medical standards when the medical procedures are performed for 

the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity 

inconsistent with the minor's sex or treating purported discomfort or distress from 

a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity because a minor's 

discordance can be resolved by less invasive approaches that are likely to result 

in better outcomes for the minor.  

(d)  The legislature finds that medical procedures are being performed on 

and administered to minors in this state for such purposes, notwithstanding the 

risks and harms to the minors. 

(e)  The legislature finds that Dr. John Money, one of the earliest 

advocates for performing or administering such medical procedures on minors 

and a founder of the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, abused minors 

entrusted to his care, resulting in the suicides of David and Brian Reimer. 

(f)  The legislature finds that such medical procedures are being 

performed on and administered to minors in this state with rapidly increasing 

frequency and that supposed guidelines advocating such treatment have 

changed substantially in recent years. 

(g)  The legislature finds that minors lack the maturity to fully understand 

and appreciate the life-altering consequences of such procedures and that many 

individuals have expressed regret for medical procedures that were performed on 

or administered to them for such purposes when they were minors. 



 

 

 

 - 3 - 000284 

 

(h)  The legislature finds that many of the same pharmaceutical 

companies that contributed to the opioid epidemic have sought to profit from the 

administration of drugs to or use of devices on minors for such purposes and 

have paid consulting fees to physicians who then advocate for administration of 

drugs or use of devices for such purposes. 

(i)  The legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have 

sought to perform such surgeries on minors because the surgeries "make a lot of 

money" and "are huge money makers," not necessarily because the surgeries 

are in a minor's best interest. 

(j)  The legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have 

threatened employees for conscientiously objecting, for religious, moral, or 

ethical reasons, to performing or administering such medical procedures.  

(k)  The legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have 

posted pictures of naked minors online to advertise such surgeries. 

(l)  The legislature finds that Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and 

North Mississippi, an organization responsible for killing tens of thousands of 

unborn children, has become one of the largest administrators in this state of 

such medical procedures. 

(m)  The legislature declares that the integrity and public respect of the 

medical profession are significantly harmed by healthcare providers performing 

or administering such medical procedures on minors.  This state has a legitimate, 

substantial, and compelling interest in protecting minors from physical and 

emotional harm.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest 

in protecting the ability of minors to develop into adults who can create children 

of their own.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling interest in 



 

 

 

 - 4 - 000284 

 

promoting the dignity of minors.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and 

compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as 

they undergo puberty.  This state has a legitimate, substantial, and compelling 

interest in protecting the integrity of the medical profession, including by 

prohibiting medical procedures that are harmful, unethical, immoral, 

experimental, or unsupported by high-quality or long-term studies, or that might 

encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex. 

(n)  Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit medical 

procedures from being administered to or performed on minors when the 

purpose of the medical procedure is to:  

(1)  Enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity 

inconsistent with the minor's sex; or  

(2)  Treat purported discomfort or distress from a discordance 

between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

68-33-102.  Definitions. 

As used in this chapter: 

(1)  "Congenital defect" means a physical or chemical abnormality present 

in a minor that is inconsistent with the normal development of a human being of 

the minor's sex, including abnormalities caused by a medically verifiable disorder 

of sex development, but does not include gender dysphoria, gender identity 

disorder, gender incongruence, or any mental condition, disorder, disability, or 

abnormality; 

(2)  "Healthcare provider" means a healthcare professional, 

establishment, or facility licensed, registered, certified, or permitted pursuant to 

this title or title 63 and regulated under the authority of: 



 

 

 

 - 5 - 000284 

 

(A)  The department of health; 

(B)  An agency, board, council, or committee attached to the 

department of health; or 

(C)  The health facilities commission; 

(3)  "Medical procedure" includes, but is not limited to: 

(A)  Surgically removing, modifying, altering, or entering into 

tissues, cavities, or organs of a human being; or 

(B)  Prescribing, administering, or dispensing any drug or device 

to a human being; 

(4)  "Minor" means an individual under eighteen (18) years of age; 

(5)  "Parent" means any biological, legal, or adoptive parent or parents of 

the minor or any legal guardian of the minor; and 

(6)  "Sex" means a person's immutable characteristics of the reproductive 

system that define the individual as male or female, as determined by anatomy 

and genetics existing at the time of birth. 

68-33-103.  Prohibitions. 

(a)  A healthcare provider shall not perform or offer to perform on a minor, 

or administer or offer to administer to a minor, a medical procedure if the 

performance or administration of the procedure is for the purpose of: 

(1)  Enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported 

identity inconsistent with the minor's sex; or  

(2)  Treating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance 

between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

 (b)   



 

 

 

 - 6 - 000284 

 

(1)  It is not a violation of subsection (a) if a healthcare provider 

performs, or offers to perform, a medical procedure on or administers, or 

offers to administer, a medical procedure to a minor if: 

(A)  The performance or administration of the medical 

procedure is to treat a minor's congenital defect, disease, or 

physical injury; or 

(B)  The performance or administration of the medical 

procedure on the minor began prior to the effective date of this 

act.  

(2)  For purposes of subdivision (b)(1)(A), "disease" does not 

include gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, gender incongruence, 

or any mental condition, disorder, disability, or abnormality. 

(3)  For purposes of subdivision (b)(1)(B), the minor's treating 

physician must certify in writing that, in the physician's good-faith medical 

judgment, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time, 

ending the medical procedure would be harmful to the minor.  The 

certification must include the findings supporting the certification and must 

be made a part of the minor's medical record. 

(4)  The exception in subdivision (b)(1)(B) does not allow a 

healthcare provider to perform or administer a medical procedure that is 

different from the medical procedure performed prior to the effective date 

of this act when the sole purpose of the different medical procedure is to: 

(A)  Enable the minor to identify with, or live as, a 

purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex; or 



 

 

 

 - 7 - 000284 

 

(B)  Treat purported discomfort or distress from a 

discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

(5)  Nothing in subdivision (b)(1)(B) abrogates a minor's right to 

bring a cause of action against a healthcare provider or the minor's parent 

pursuant to § 68-33-104.  

 (c)  

(1)  It is not a defense to any legal liability incurred as the result of 

a violation of this section that the minor, or a parent of the minor, 

consented to the conduct that constituted the violation.  

(2)  This section supersedes any common law rule regarding a 

minor's ability to consent to a medical procedure that is performed or 

administered for the purpose of: 

(A)  Enabling the minor to identify with, or live as, a 

purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex; or  

(B)  Treating purported discomfort or distress from a 

discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity. 

68-33-104.  Private Right of Action. 

 (a)   

(1)  Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (a)(3), a minor, or 

the parent of a minor, injured as a result of a violation of § 68-33-103, 

may bring a civil cause of action to recover compensatory damages, 

punitive damages, and reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and 

expenses. 

(2)  A minor injured as a result of a violation of § 68-33-103 may 

bring a civil cause of action pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) against the:  



 

 

 

 - 8 - 000284 

 

(A)  Healthcare provider alleged to have violated § 68-33-

103; and 

(B)  Minor's parent if the parent of the minor consented to 

the conduct that constituted the violation on behalf of the minor.  

This subdivision (a)(2)(B) supersedes any common law immunity 

granted to a parent.  If this subdivision (a)(2)(B) or its application 

to any person or circumstance is held invalid, then the invalidity 

does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that 

can be given effect without this subdivision (a)(2)(B) or 

application, and to that end, this subdivision (a)(2)(B) is severable. 

(3)  The parent of a minor injured as a result of a violation of § 68-

33-103 may bring a civil cause of action pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) 

against a healthcare provider alleged to have violated § 68-33-103.  The 

parent of a minor injured as a result of a violation of § 68-33-103 shall not 

bring a civil cause of action against a healthcare provider if the parent 

consented to the conduct that constituted the violation on behalf of the 

minor. 

(b)  The parent or next of kin of a minor may bring a wrongful death 

action, pursuant to title 20, chapter 5, part 1, against a healthcare provider 

alleged to have violated § 68-33-103, if the injured minor is deceased and: 

(1)  The minor's death is the result of the physical or emotional 

harm inflicted upon the minor by the violation; and 

(2)  The parent of the minor did not consent to the conduct that 

constituted the violation on behalf of the minor. 



 

 

 

 - 9 - 000284 

 

(c)  If a court in any civil action brought pursuant to this section finds that 

a healthcare provider knowingly violated § 68-33-103, then the court shall notify 

the appropriate regulatory authority and the attorney general and reporter by 

mailing a certified copy of the court's order to the regulatory authority and the 

attorney general and reporter.  Notification pursuant to this subsection (c) shall 

be made upon the judgment of the court being made final.  

(d)  For purposes of subsection (a), compensatory damages may include: 

(1)  Reasonable economic losses caused by the emotional, 

mental, or physical effects of the violation, including, but not limited to: 

(A)  The cost of counseling, hospitalization, and any other 

medical expenses connected with treating the harm caused by the 

violation; 

(B)  Any out-of-pocket costs of the minor paid to the 

healthcare provider for the prohibited medical procedure; and 

(C)  Loss of income caused by the violation; and

not limited to, psychological and emotional anguish. 

(e)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action commenced under 

this section must be brought: 

(1)  Within thirty (30) years from the date the minor reaches 

eighteen (18) years of age; or  

(2)  Within ten (10) years of the minor's death if the minor dies. 

(f)  This section is declared to be remedial in nature, and this section must 

be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.  

68-33-105.  Attorney General and Reporter's Right of Action. 



 

 

 

 - 10 - 000284 

 

(a)  The attorney general and reporter shall establish a process by which 

violations of § 68-33-103 may be reported. 

(b)  The attorney general and reporter may bring an action against a 

healthcare provider that knowingly violates § 68-33-103, within twenty (20) years 

of the violation, to enjoin further violations, to disgorge any profits received due to 

the medical procedure, and to recover a civil penalty of twenty-five thousand 

dollars ($25,000) per violation. 

(c)  A civil penalty collected pursuant to this section must be paid into the 

general fund of this state. 

(d)  The attorney general and reporter is entitled to reasonable attorney's 

fees, court costs, and expenses if the attorney general and reporter prevails in an 

action brought pursuant to this section. 

(e)  Jurisdiction for an action brought pursuant to this section is in the 

chancery or circuit court of Williamson County or circuit court in the county where 

the violation occurred.   

68-33-106.  Healthcare Provider Licensing Sanctions.  

A violation of § 68-33-103 constitutes a potential threat to public health, 

safety, and welfare and requires emergency action by an alleged violator's 

appropriate regulatory authority.  Upon receiving notification pursuant to § 68-33-

104(c), or upon otherwise becoming aware of an alleged violation of § 68-33-103, 

the appropriate regulatory authority shall proceed pursuant to title 63 or this title, 

as applicable.  

68-33-107.  Minor Immunity.

SECTION 3.  If any provision of this act, or its application to any person or circumstance 

is held invalid, then the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this act that 

can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of 

this act are severable. 

SECTION 4.  The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not 

constitute a part of the law enacted by this act.  However, the Tennessee Code Commission is 

requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.

INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE BURGER.

0423H.01I DANA RADEMAN MILLER, Chief Clerk

AN ACT
To amend chapter 163, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to participation in

athletic competitions.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:

Section A. Chapter 163, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto one new section, to be
2 known as section 163.048, to read as follows:

163.048. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "Athletics", any interscholastic athletic games, contests, programs, activities,
3 exhibitions, or other similar competitions organized and provided for students;
4 (2) "Sex", the two main categories of male and female into which individuals are
5 divided based on an individual's reproductive biology at birth and the individual's
6 genome.
7 2. (1) The general assembly hereby finds the following:
8 (a) A noticeable disparity continues between the athletics participation rates of
9 students who are male and students who are female;

10 (b) Courts have recognized a legitimate and important governmental interest in
11 redressing past discrimination against females in athletics on the basis of sex and
12 promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the sexes under Title IX of the
13 federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Section 1681 et seq.), as amended;
14 and
15 (c) Courts have recognized that classification by sex is the only feasible
16 classification to promote the governmental interest of providing opportunities for
17 athletics for females.

EXPLANATION — Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.



18 (2) The general assembly hereby declares that it is the public policy of this state
19 to further the governmental interest of ensuring that sufficient opportunities for
20 athletics remain available for females to remedy past discrimination on the basis of sex.
21 3. (1) Except as provided under subdivision (2) of this subsection, no school
22 district or charter school shall allow any student to compete in an athletics competition
23 that is designated for the biological sex opposite to the student's biological sex as
24 correctly stated on the student's official birth certificate as described in subsection 4 of
25 this section or, if the student's official birth certificate is unobtainable, another
26 government record.
27 (2) A school district or charter school may allow a female student to compete in
28 an athletics competition that is designated for male students if no corresponding
29 athletics competition designated for female students is offered or available.
30 4. For purposes of this section, a statement of a student's biological sex on the
31 student's official birth certificate or another government record shall be deemed to have
32 correctly stated the student's biological sex only if the statement was:
33 (1) Entered at or near the time of the student's birth; or
34 (2) Modified to correct any scrivener's error in the student's biological sex.
35 5. No school district or charter school that violates subdivision (1) of subsection 3
36 of this section shall receive any state aid under this chapter or any other revenues from
37 the state.
38 6. The department of elementary and secondary education shall promulgate all
39 necessary rules and regulations for the implementation and administration of this
40 section. Such rules and regulations shall ensure compliance with state and federal law
41 regarding the confidentiality of student medical information. Any rule or portion of a
42 rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority
43 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
44 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and
45 chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
46 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul
47 a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority
48 and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void.

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

As used in the School Establishment Clause Act (SECA): 

1.  “Biological female” means a female person, a woman, or a 

girl who was born with female anatomy and with two (2) X chromosomes 

in the person’s cells; 

2.  “Biological male” means a male person, a man, or a boy who 

was born with male anatomy and with X and Y chromosomes in the 

person’s cells; 

3.  “Coed” means a sports activity designation that permissibly

neutral purposes, not to advance a religious worldview; 

4.  “Contemporary community standards of decency” means 

standards based on the reasonable observer perspective which are 

violated by appeals to the prurient interest or the patently 

offensive to the extent the appeals harm the general decency, 

safety, health, and welfare of the community.  Acts of 

licentiousness shall be considered antithetical to this standard;

5.  “Drag queen story time” means a non-secular event where men 

dress up as women and display an inherently sexualized performance 

targeting minors with the purpose of promoting and normalizing the 

faith-based beliefs and practices that stem from the secular 

humanist religion.  Drag queen story time shall include but not be 

limited to an event that targets children and promotes 

licentiousness in attempts to justify practices inconsistent with

orientation; 

8.  “Lemon test” means a three-prong test originally created by

action fails to satisfy any of the prongs.  The test requires that

inhibiting religion, and

religion; 

9.  “Logical nexus” means at least some minimal, relevant,

fact;

and is not predicated on self-evident neutral truth and is a story 

that provides the individual with a sense of purpose and serves as a 

commentary on sexual practices, sexual preference, faith, morality, 

and life.  The term shall include but not be limited to expressions 

and speech that are often controversial, sexualized, questionably 

moral, questionably plausible, and have a tendency to erode 

community standards of decency and promote licentiousness; 

12.  “Promote” means to advocate for, assist with, encourage, or 

popularize through advertising or publicity;

13.  “Public school” means a public educational institution that 

is maintained at public expense for the education of the children of 

a community or district and that constitutes a part of a system of 

free public education including primary and secondary schools from 

grades prekindergarten through twelve.  The term shall include 

accredited nonpublic educational institutions including primary and 

secondary schools from grades prekindergarten through twelve; 

14.  “Reasonable observer” means a person of ordinary prudence 

who views a policy or action from an objective standard point in the 

context of the state’s longstanding practice and through the lens of 

self-evident neutral, natural, and non-controversial transcultural 

morality; 

15.  “Religion” means a set of unproven answers to the greater 

questions like “why are we here,” “what should we be doing as 

humans,” “how do we get our identity,” and “what happens after 

death.” The term means a closed system and group or community that 

is organized, full, and provides a comprehensive code by which 

individuals may guide their daily activities.  Religion includes an 

ultimate concern or sincere belief and can be non-theistic or 

theistic; 

16.  “Secular humanism” means a faith-based worldview that is 

also referred to as postmodern-western-individualistic moral 

relativism, expressive individualism, or antitheism and is often the 

mirror opposite of theism.  The term refers to a religion that

worships man as the source of all knowledge and truth.  The term 

includes a belief system that is centered on the unproven 

assumptions that there are no moral absolutes and no one moral 

doctrine should be used as the superior basis for law and policy, 

except for the religious doctrines of secular humanism.  The term 

includes a series of unproven faith-based assumptions and naked 

assertions that suggest that morality and truth are man-made 

conventions and that at the heart of liberty is man’s ability to 

define his own meaning of the universe.  The term refers to a 

religion that tends to promote licentiousness and to justify 

practices that are inconsistent with the peace and safety of the 

state.  The term refers to the belief that man is merely a bundle of 

chemicals, animated pieces of meat, or accidental particles, that 

nature is all there is, and that there is nothing after death.  

Nonsecular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives and sexual 

orientation orthodoxy are doctrines that are inseparably linked to 

secular humanism.  The term includes but is not limited to a 

religion that has many different denominational sects and is 

expressed in widely varying ways; 

17.  “Sexual orientation” means a person’s sexual identity or 

self-identification as homosexual, lesbian, or transgender.  The 

term means a mythology, dogma, doctrine, ideology, or orthodoxy that 

is inseparably linked to the religion of secular humanism.  The term 

includes non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives

that are often predicated on a series of unproven faith-based 

assumptions and naked assertions that are implicitly religious and 

have a tendency to erode community standards of decency and promote 

licentiousness.  The term may be used interchangeably with gender 

identity, given that they are both faith-based sexual commentaries 

on morality that come from secular humanism; and 

18.  “Taxpayer standing” means the standing of a taxpayer to 

file a lawsuit against a government actor that is directly or 

symbolically engaging in practices that violate the Establishment 

Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or 

Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution after the 

government actor actually or prospectively engaged in action that 

potentially failed at least one prong of the lemon test.  A taxpayer 

shall have a logical nexus to a government actor’s violation to 

assert taxpayer standing.  A person who pays sales tax in this state 

can successfully assert this form of standing before the courts of 

competent jurisdiction.

A.  Pursuant to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment 

of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the 

Oklahoma Constitution, a public school is prohibited from creating, 

enforcing, or endorsing a policy that respects, favors, endorses, or 

promotes non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives or 

sexual orientation orthodoxy because such policies fail the lemon 

test for: 

1.  Constituting non-secular shams that lack a primary secular 

purpose; 

2.  Cultivating indefensible legal weapons against non-observers 

of the religion of secular humanism; and 

3.  Having the effect of excessively entangling the government 

with the religion of secular humanism. 

B.  Pursuant to the First Amendment to and the Establishment 

Clause of the United States Constitution, Article II, Section 5 of 

the Oklahoma Constitution, and the state’s compelling interest to 

discourage licentiousness, a public school shall not create or

asserted sex-based identity ideology or sexual orientation orthodoxy 

unless the curriculum is part of a sex education program and only 

after a student’s parent or legal guardian has: 

a. intentionally opted their child into participating in 

the curriculum in writing, and 

b. received a notification from the school district or 

the State Department of Education that the messaging 

could expose their child to licentiousness and one 

particular religious worldview;

SECTION 6.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified

is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows: 

A.  The School Establishment Clause Act (SECA) is constructed on 

the premise that: 

1.  The United States is a constitutional republic of which the 

State of Oklahoma is a part; 

2.  The United States Constitution is the supreme sovereign law 

of this country that preempts all state and federal law; 

3.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution 

applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United 

States Constitution; 

4.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the 

United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma 

Constitution were not merely designed to prevent the state from 

respecting and promoting the doctrines of institutionalized 

religions but those of non-institutionalized religions; 

5.  All members of the Legislature and all executive and 

judicial officers are bound by oath or affirmation pursuant to 

Article VI, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution to not create 

or enforce policies that violate the Establishment Clause or the 

Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States 

Constitution regardless of the member’s or officer’s party 

affiliation or personal religious beliefs;

the controlling constitutional authority in informing this state on 

how to respond and react to self-asserted sex-based identity 

narratives and sexual orientation orthodoxy and the Equal Protection 

and substantive Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to 

the United States Constitution have no applicability; 

7.  Emotional appeals shall not be used to usurp the 

Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States 

Constitution or Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution 

in an effort to justify the government’s creation or enforcement of 

policies that respect non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity 

narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy; 

8.  All policies put forth by public schools that respect or 

recognize non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives 

and sexual orientation orthodoxy fail the lemon test first 

established by the United States Supreme Court and are thereby 

preempted by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the 

United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma 

Constitution in their making and enforcement and shall be enjoined 

from enforcement because the policies: 

a. constitute non-secular shams that lack a primary 

secular purpose;

9.  The Legislature recognizes that in the wake of the decisions 

by the United States Supreme Court that forced the state’s 

entanglement with the religion of secular humanism, there has been 

no rush on non-secular marriage, but there has been a rush on: 

a. public schools and public libraries by devout secular 

humanists for the sole purpose of targeting and 

indoctrinating minors with the licentious religion of 

secular humanism with the government’s stamp of 

approval at the taxpayers’ expense, and 

b. the social marginalization and systematic persecution 

of non-observers of the religion of secular humanism; 

10.  The Legislature recognizes that it is not proven or 

disproven whether sexual orientation is predicated on immutability 

and genetics and is, therefore, a matter of religious faith that 

falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Establishment Clause 

balanced with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the 

United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma 

Constitution; and 

11.  This state shall be particularly vigilant in monitoring 

compliance with the Establishment Clause of the United States

Constitution in the public school context to protect minors from 

religious indoctrination with the government’s stamp of approval, 

especially when that religious ideology promotes licentiousness. 

B.  SECA shall not be construed as prohibiting students or 

teachers from believing in or from refusing to believe in the 

plausibility of non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity 

narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy or secular humanist 

practices because such beliefs and practices are protected under the 

Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States 

Constitution and under Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma 

Constitution.  SECA shall be constructed on the premise that 

protections of religious practices under the Free Exercise Clause of 

the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 

II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution are not absolute, and 

this state is authorized to regulate or prohibit certain religious 

practices pursuant to its inherent police powers afforded under the 

Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution if those practices 

promote licentiousness or are inconsistent with the peace and safety 

of the state.  The Legislature recognizes that it is self-evident 

that non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives and 

sexual orientation orthodoxy promote licentiousness and attempts to 

justify practices are inconsistent with the peace and safety of this 

state.

If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, 

clause, phrase, or word of the School Establishment Clause Act 

(SECA) is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, the 

holding shall not affect the constitutionality or validity of the

would have passed this and each and every section, subsection, 

paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, 

irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, 

subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, 

or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional, invalid, or 

otherwise ineffective. 

SECTION 8.     NEW LAW     A new section of law not to be 

codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows: 

The Legislature hereby recognizes the following findings: 

1.  The United States Constitution is not silent as to how this 

state shall respond and react to lesbian, gay, bisexual, 

transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) issues and sexual orientation 

orthodoxy for the matters are addressed exclusively by the 

Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment 

to the United States Constitution, not the substantive Due Process

Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation Inc., 551 U.S. 587 (2007) 

that the Establishment Clause applies to the executive branch, which 

includes Oklahoma’s public schools; 

5.  The Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution 

was never solely designed to prohibit the government from respecting

and recognizing the doctrines of institutionalized religions but of 

non-institutionalized religions, such as secular humanism; 

6.  The United States Supreme Court found that secular humanism 

is a religion for the purposes of the First Amendment in: 

a. Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), 

b. School District of Abington Township, Pa. v. Schempp, 

374 U.S. 203 (1963), 

c. United States v. Seeger, 380 US 163 (1965), and 

d. Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970); 

7.  Most of the United States courts of appeals have found that 

secular humanism is a religion for purposes of the First Amendment 

in cases such as: 

a. Malnak v. Yogi, 592 F.2d 197 (3d Cir.1979), 

b. Theriault v. Silber, 547 F.2d 1279 (5th Cir.1977),

identity narratives, such as homosexuality and transgenderism, and 

sexual orientation orthodoxy are doctrines, ideologies, and dogmas 

that are part of a worldview consisting of a series of unproven 

faith-based assumptions and naked assertions that are implicitly 

religious and inseparably linked to the religion of secular 

humanism; 

9.  The LGBTQ community is centered on a “closed system” that is 

organized, full, and provides a comprehensive code by which 

individuals may guide their daily activities, making LGBTQ secular 

humanism a religion in view of the legal definition of what 

constitutes a religion provided by the courts in cases such as 

United States v. Seeger, 380 US 163 (1965); Welsh v. United States, 

398 U.S. 333 (1970); and Real Alternatives, Inc. v. Sec’y Dep’t of 

Health & Human Servs.,150 F. Supp. 3d 419 (3d Cir. Aug. 4,2017); 

10.  Instead of having a cross, the Ten Commandments, or the 

star and crescent, the LGBTQ secular humanist religion has the 

rainbow-colored flag to symbolize its religious beliefs, practices, 

and values; 

11.  The beliefs that a person “was born with a gay gene” or 

“was born in the wrong body” and is thereby entitled to special 

treatment amounts to a series of unproven faith-based assumptions 

and naked assertions that are implicitly religious and cannot be 

used as the basis for law and policy because the Establishment

Clause prohibits such beliefs from being legally promoted, endorsed, 

or respected by government; 

12.  Regardless of political affiliation, all members of the 

Legislature and all executive and judicial officers are bound by 

oath to put their own political and religious beliefs aside and to 

comply with their duty to honor their oath of office pursuant to 

Article VI, Clause 3 to uphold the United States Constitution and 

to, therefore, immediately stop creating, respecting, and enforcing 

policies that promote the plausibility of non-secular self-asserted 

sex-based identity narratives and sexual orientation orthodoxy 

because all of those policies fail all three prongs of the lemon 

test established by the United States Supreme Court in Lemon v. 

Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) for: 

a. constituting non-secular shams that lack a primary 

secular purpose, 

b. cultivating indefensible legal weapons against non-

observers of the religion of secular humanism, and 

c. serving to excessively entangle the government with 

the religion of secular humanism; 

13.  The United States Supreme Court in Edwards v. Aguillard, 

482 U.S. 578 (1987) and Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997) 

found that if government action fails one prong of the lemon test, 

it is unconstitutional, and the evidence shows that the enforcement 

and creation of policies that respect non-secular self-asserted sex-

based identity narratives or sexual orientation ideology fail all 

three prongs of the lemon test; 

14.  The United States Supreme Court in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 

577 (1992) found that there are “heightened concerns with protecting 

freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the 

elementary and secondary public schools,” while also holding in 

Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987) that the government 

“should be particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the 

Establishment Clause in the public-school context,” when minors are 

subjected to religious indoctrination with the perception of the 

government’s stamp of approval; 

15.  The federal courts have held in cases like Holloman v. 

Harland, 370 F.3 1252 (11th Cir. 2004) that neither emotional 

appeals nor sincerity of belief can be used to usurp the 

Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and all policies that 

respect and promote non-secular self-asserted sex-based identity 

narratives and sexual orientation orthodoxy have been based on a 

series of emotional appeals at the expense of this principle; 

16.  The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 

(2015), United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), and 

Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019)

appeals as a way to get around the Establishment Clause of the First 

Amendment to the United States Constitution; 

17.  In the wake of Obergefell v. Hodges,135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), 

United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), and Bostock v. 

Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019), there has 

not been the promised equality, tolerance, and unity, but instead 

there has been division, domination by secular humanists, the 

proliferation of moral superiority complexes by moral relativists, 

cancel culture, the erosion of the integrity of the legal basis 

supporting the race-based civil rights movement which is objectively 

based on immutability, increased sexual exploitation and 

licentiousness, the proliferation of sexual confusion amongst 

minors, and the marginalization and even violent oppression of non-

observers of the religion of secular humanism, demonstrating that 

those decisions amount to some of the greatest non-secular shams 

since the inception of American jurisprudence; 

18.  The United States Supreme Court’s position in INS v. Chada, 

462 U.S. 919 (1983) and Nixon v. U.S., 506 U.S. 224 (1993) 

emphasized that the legislative branch shall serve as a check on the 

judicial and executive branch, and by enacting the School 

Establishment Clause Act (SECA), the legislature shall be fulfilling 

that duty;

Fla. v. South Carolina, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) and in St. Joseph Stock

Yards Co. v. United States, 298 U.S. 38 (1936) that “Stare Decisis 

is at its weakest when the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution 

because its decisions can be altered only by constitutional 

amendment or by overruling prior decisions”; 

20.  Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), United States 

v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), and Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. Bd. 

of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019) merely involved 

constitutional interpretation which means that Stare Decisis is at 

its weakest involving those decisions; 

21.  The United States Supreme Court in Cooper Industries, Inc. 

v. Aviall Services, Inc. 543 U.S. 157 (2004) stated that 

“[constitutional] questions which merely lurk in the record, neither 

brought to [the] attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to 

be considered as having been so decided as to constitute 

precedents;” 

22.  In Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 

1599 (2019), Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), and United 

States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), the controlling 

applicability of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to 

the United States Constitution regarding sexual orientation 

orthodoxy was lurking in the shadows of those cases but not decided 

upon by the Supreme Court, which means that Stare Decisis does not 

apply, and those cases are subjected to being overruled for being 

framed on the wrong constitutional narrative;

23.  The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that 

the states have a compelling interest to uphold community standards 

of decency, to discourage licentiousness, and to enact policies that 

stop attempts to justify practices that are inconsistent with the 

peace and safety of the state, as underscored by the state’s 

inherent police powers in the Tenth Amendment to the United States 

Constitution; 

24.  The United States Supreme Court found in Ginsberg v. New 

York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968) and Mishkin v. State of New York, 383 U.S. 

502 (1966) that “to simply adjust the definition of obscenity to 

social realities has always failed to be persuasive before the 

Courts of the United States”, and such adjustments fail to be 

persuasive to this state; 

25.  Courts, in cases like Schlegel v. United States, 416 F. 2d 

1372 (Ct. Cl. 1969), have held as a matter of self-evident 

observation that “any schoolboy knows that a homosexual act is 

immoral, indecent, lewd, and obscene.  Adult persons are even more 

conscious that this is true”; 

26.  A public school policy that permits self-identified 

transvestites who are biological males to participate in sports for 

biological females in an attempt to show respect to their non-

secular self-asserted sex-based identity narrative fails the three 

prongs of the lemon test by a landslide, promotes licentiousness, 

erodes community standards of decency, and is an attempt to justify

practices that are inconsistent with the peace and safety of the 

state; 

27.  The United States Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. 

Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019) was 

invalid because requiring that “sexual orientation” be read into the 

term “sex” in Title VIII, 42 U.S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1) causes the 

statute to lack a primary secular purpose and excessively entangles 

the government with the religion of secular humanism as advocated by 

the LGBTQ denomination; 

28.  Males and females are self-evidently different but equal as 

implicated by the following neutral and secular considerations: 

a. according to the United States Supreme Court in United 

States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), there 

are “inherent differences between men and women,” and 

these differences “remain cause for celebration, but 

not for denigration of the members of either sex or 

for artificial constraints on an individual’s 

opportunity”, 

b. these “inherent differences” range from chromosomal 

and hormonal differences to physiological differences, 

c. according to Neel Burton, “The Battle of the Sexes,” 

33 Psychology Today (July 2, 2012), men generally have 

“denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments” and

“larger hearts, greater lung volume per body mass, a 

higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin”, 

d. according to Doriane Lambelet Coleman, “Sex in Sport”, 

Law and Contemporary Problems 63-126 (2017) (quoting 

Gina Kolata, “Men, Women 2 and Speed. Words: Got 

Testosterone?”, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)), men also 

have higher natural levels of testosterone, which 

affects traits such as hemoglobin levels, body fat 

content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the 

development of type 2 muscle fibers, all of which 

result in men being able to generate higher speed and 

power during physical activity, 

e. the biological differences between men and women, 

especially related to natural levels of testosterone, 

explains the male and female secondary sex 

characteristics which develop during puberty and have 

life-long effects, including those most important for 

success in sport: categorically different strength, 

speed, and endurance, according to Doriane Lambelet 

Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, “Comparing Athletic 

Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,” 

Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy,

disfavored, the United States Supreme Court in United

States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), 

recognized that “sex classifications may be used to 

compensate women for particular economic disabilities 

[they have] suffered, promote equal employment 

opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the 

talent and capacities of our Nation’s people”, 

g. one place where sex classifications allow for the 

“full development of the talent and capacities of our 

Nation’s people” is in the context of sports and 

athletics, 

h. courts have recognized that the inherent, 

physiological differences between males and females 

result in different athletic capabilities.  For 

example, Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 26 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (“Because 

of innate physiological differences, boys and girls 

are not similarly situated as they enter athletic 

competition.”); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass’n, 394 

N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that 

“high school boys [generally possess physiological 

advantages over] their girl counterparts” and that 

those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls 

in some sports like “high school track”),

i. a recent study of female and male Olympic performances 

since 1983 by Valerie Thibault, et al., “Women and Men 

in Sport Performance: The Gender Gap Has Not Evolved 

Since 1983,” Journal of Sports Science & Medicine, 

Vol. 9, No.2 (2010), found that although athletes from 

both sexes improved over the time span, the “gender 

gap” between female and male performances remained 

stable, which suggests that “women’s performances at 

the high level will never match those of men”, 

j. as Duke University School of Law professor and all-

American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold 

medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently wrote, “[T]he 

evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in 

every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, 

there will always be significant numbers of boys and 

men who would beat the best girls and women in head-

to-head competition.  Claims to the contrary are 

simply a denial of science.” (Doriane Coleman, Martina 

Navratilova, et al., “Pass the Equality Act, But Don’t 

Abandon Title IX,” Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019)), 

k. the benefits that natural testosterone provides to 

male athletes are not diminished through the use of 

puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.  A recent

study on the impact of treatments regarding puberty 

blockers and cross-sex hormones found that even “after 

12 months of hormonal 17 therapy,” a man who 

identifies as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones 

“had an absolute advantage” over female athletes and 

“will still likely have performance benefits” over 

women. (Wilk, Anna, et al., “Muscle Strength, Size and 

Composition Following 12 Months of Gender-Affirming 

Treatment in Transgender Individuals,” The Journal of 

Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, Vol. 105, No. 3 

(2019)), and 

l. having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to 

promote sex equality and accomplishes this aim by 

providing opportunities for female athletes to 

demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic 

abilities while also providing them with opportunities 

to obtain recognition and accolades, college 

scholarships, and the numerous other long-term 

benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors.

of representatives and the attorney general.

(g) Following  a  restricted  financial  company's  inclusion  on  the

company  ceases  engaging  in  ideological  boycotts,  the  treasurer  shall 
remove the financial company from the list maintained under section 7, 
and amendments thereto. In which case, the provisions of this act shall no

(d) If, after the time provided by subsection (b) expires, the financial 
company continues to engage in ideological boycotts, the board shall sell, 
redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the financial 
company,  except  securities  described  by  section  11,  and  amendments 
thereto,  according  to  the  schedule  provided  by  section  10,  and 
amendments thereto.

New Sec. 10. (a) When the board is required to sell, redeem, divest or 
withdraw all publicly traded securities of a listed financial company, the 
board shall comply with the following schedule:

(1) At least 50% of those assets shall be removed from the system's 
assets under management not  later than the 180th day after the date the 
financial  company  receives  notice  under  section  9,  and  amendments 
thereto, or subsection (b) unless the board determines that a later date is 
more  prudent,  based  on  a  good  faith  exercise  of  the  board's  fiduciary 
discretion and subject to paragraph (2); and

(2) 100% of such assets shall be removed from the system's assets 
under management not later than the 360th day after the date the financial 
company receives  notice  under  section  9,  and  amendments  thereto,  or 
subsection (b).

(b) If  a  financial  company  that  ceased  engaging  in  ideological 
boycotts after receiving notice under section 9, and amendments thereto, 
resumes such financial company's boycott, the board shall send a written 
notice to the financial company informing such financial company that the 
board will sell, redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly traded securities of 
the financial company according to the schedule in subsection (a).

(c) Except  as provided by subsection (a),  the board may delay the 
schedule for divestment under such subsection only to the extent that the 
board determines, in the board's good faith judgment and consistent with 
the board's fiduciary duty, that divestment from listed financial companies 
will likely result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation as provided 
by section 12(b), and amendments thereto. If the board delays the schedule 
for  divestment,  the  board  shall  submit  a  report  to  the  treasurer,  the 
president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the 
attorney general stating the reasons and justification for the board's delay 
in  divestment  from listed financial  companies.  The report  shall  include 
documentation supporting the board's  determination that  the  divestment 
would result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation as provided by 
section  12(b),  and  amendments  thereto,  including  objective  numerical 
estimates. The board shall update the report every six months.

New Sec. 11. The board is also required to divest from any indirect 
holdings  in  actively or  passively managed  investment  funds  or  private 
equity funds containing listed financial companies. The board shall submit 
letters to the managers of each investment fund containing listed financial

companies requesting that they remove such financial companies from the 
fund or create a similar actively or passively managed fund with indirect 
holdings  devoid  of  listed  financial  companies.  If  a  manager  creates  a 
similar  fund  with  substantially  the  same  management  fees  and 
substantially the same level of investment risk and anticipated return, the 
board  may  replace  all  applicable  investments  with  investments  in  the 
similar fund in a time frame consistent with prudent fiduciary standards 
but  not  later  than the 450th day after  the date the fund is  created.  If  a 
manager does not  create such similar fund,  the board shall  divest  from 
such indirect holdings in actively or passively managed investment funds 
or private equity funds.

New Sec. 12. (a) Except as provided by this section, the system may 
not acquire securities of a listed financial company.

(b) The board may cease divesting from one or more listed financial 
companies only if clear and convincing evidence shows that:

(1) The system has suffered or will suffer a greater than 25% loss in 
the hypothetical value of all assets under management by the system as a 
result of having to divest from listed financial companies under this act; or

(2) an  individual  portfolio  that  uses  a  benchmark-aware  strategy 
would be subject to an aggregate expected deviation from its benchmark of 
greater  than  25% as  a  result  of  having  to  divest  from listed  financial 
companies under this act.

(c) The board may cease divesting from a listed financial company as 
provided by this section only to the extent  necessary to ensure that  the 
system does not suffer a loss in value or deviate from its benchmark as 
described by subsection (b).

(d) Before  the  board  may  cease  divesting  from  a  listed  financial 
company under this section, the board shall provide a written report to the 
treasurer,  the  president  of  the  senate,  the  speaker  of  the  house  of 
representatives  and  the  attorney  general  stating  the  reason  and 
justification, supported by clear and convincing evidence, for deciding to 
cease divestment or to remain invested in a listed financial company.

(e) The  board  shall  update  the  report  required  by  subsection  (d) 
semiannually, as applicable.

(f) This section does not apply to reinvestment in a financial company 
that is no longer a listed financial company.

New Sec. 13. Not later than the first day of the regular session of the 
legislature, each year, the board shall file a report with the treasurer, the 
president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the

compliance with section 10, and amendments thereto;

factors.

(d) Unless  no  economically  practicable  alternative  is  available,

system's website for review by the public.

(f) The  provisions  of  sections  21  through  23,  and  amendments 
thereto, or any contract subject to the provisions of sections 21 through 23, 
and amendments thereto, may be enforced by the attorney general. The

damages to the governmental entity in an amount equal to three times all 
moneys paid to the company by the governmental entity for the company's 
services.

through any intermediary or third party, with another company or group of 
companies, to discriminate in the provision of financial services against a 
person based on the person's social credit score, including by refusing to

insurance  and  the  credit  union  administrator  shall  adopt  rules  and 
regulations  for  the  enforcement  of  sections  24  through  27,  and 
amendments thereto.  Such rules and regulations shall  be adopted on or 
before July 1, 2024.

New Sec.  28. (a)  A registered  investment  adviser  shall  disclose  to 
such registered investment adviser's clients, prior to the investment of any 
moneys owned by the client in or through any mutual fund, actively or 
passively managed equity fund,  company or  financial  institution that  is 
engaged in ideological boycotts, is a listed financial company or is on the 
restricted financial institutions list prepared, maintained and published by 
the treasurer pursuant to section 15, and amendments thereto,  that  such 
mutual  fund,  actively  or  passively  managed  equity  fund,  company  or 
financial  institution  is  engaged  in  ideological  boycotts  and  that  such 
ideological boycotts may limit the client's return on investment.

(b) Prior to the investment of a client's funds, a registered investment 
adviser  shall  obtain  written  consent  from  such  registered  investment 
adviser's client stating that the client is fully aware of and consents to the 
investment  of  funds  owned  by the  client  or  through  any  mutual  fund, 
actively  or  passively  managed  equity  fund,  company  or  financial 
institution that  is  engaged in ideological  boycotts.  Such written consent 
shall consist of the following disclosure:

"The institution managing this fund is engaged in ideological boycotts. 
If  such  boycotts  are  used  in  managing  your  fund,  these  boycotts  may 
reduce the fund's returns compared to the fund's historical performance or 
the performance of funds that do not use ideological boycotts. You may 
have  the  option  to  chose  a  similar  fund  that  does  not  use  ideological 
boycotts. By signing below, you consent to have your investment managed 
by this institution even if  the institution engages in ideological  boycott 
investment practices that may reduce your returns compared to historical 
performance or other funds."

practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or 
deceit in accordance with K.S.A. 17-12a502, and amendments thereto.

requirements  for  registration,  capital,  custody,  margin,  financial

general may investigate possible violations of this section in accordance 
with the provisions of K.S.A. 50-631, and amendments thereto.

New Sec. 29. The provisions of this act are severable. If any portion 
of the act is declared unconstitutional or invalid, or the application of any 
portion of the act to any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional or 
invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other portions of the act that can be 
given  effect  without  the  invalid  portion  or  application,  and  the

of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in 
any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner 
whatever.

(c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the  amount,  extent  or  kind  of  coverage  available  to  an  individual,  or 
charging  an  individual  a  different  rate  for  the  same  coverage  solely 
because  of  blindness  or  partial  blindness.  With  respect  to  all  other 
conditions,  including  the  underlying  cause  of  the  blindness  or  partial 
blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the 
same  standards  of  sound  actuarial  principles  or  actual  or  reasonably 
anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes 
denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that 
the  policy defines  "disability"  as  being presumed in  the  event  that  the 
insured  loses  such person's  eyesight.  However,  an insurer  may exclude 
from  coverage  disabilities  consisting  solely  of  blindness  or  partial 
blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

(d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health 
and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a 
different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for 
losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based 
on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or 
may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
(d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined 
in  K.S.A.  60-3102,  and  amendments  thereto,  between family members, 
current  or  former  household  members,  or  current  or  former  intimate 
partners.

(i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health 
insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may 
be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek 
medical or psychological  treatment or counseling specifically for abuse, 
protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.

(ii) Nothing in this section shall  be construed to  prohibit  a  person 
from  declining  to  issue  an  insurance  policy  insuring  the  life  of  an 
individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if 
the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the 
insurance policy.

(iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an 
individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall 
be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered 
by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.

(iv) No person shall  refuse to  insure,  refuse  to  continue to  insure, 
limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or

charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or 
mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is 
based on sound actuarial principles.

(v) Nothing in  this  section shall  be  construed  to  prohibit  a  person 
from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or 
mental  condition,  even  if  such  condition  has  been  caused  by  abuse, 
provided that:

(A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the 
same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim 
of abuse;

(B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of 
abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and

(C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this 
section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.

(vi) Any  person  who  underwrites  or  rates  a  risk  on  the  basis  of 
preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
(v),  shall  treat  such  underwriting  or  rating  as  an  adverse  underwriting 
decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.

(vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life 
and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective 
date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the 
effective date of this act.

(e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an 
individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage, 
solely because of such individual's  status as a living organ donor.  With 
respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall 
be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or 
reasonably  anticipated  experience  as  are  persons  who  are  not  organ 
donors.

(8) Rebates. (a)  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  by  law, 
knowingly permitting,  offering to  make or  making any contract  of  life 
insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to 
such  contract  other  than  as  plainly expressed  in  the  insurance  contract 
issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give, 
directly or  indirectly,  as  inducement  to  such  insurance,  or  annuity,  any 
rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage 
in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or 
inducement  whatever  not  specified  in  the  contract;  or  giving,  selling, 
purchasing or  offering to  give,  sell  or  purchase  as  inducement  to  such 
insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds 
or  other  securities  of  any  insurance  company  or  other  corporation, 
association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or

anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
(b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including 

within  the  definition  of  discrimination  or  rebates  any of  the  following 
practices:

(i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying 
bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or 
in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any 
such  bonuses  or  abatement  of  premiums shall  be  fair  and  equitable  to 
policyholders  and  for  the  best  interests  of  the  company  and  its 
policyholders;

(ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit 
plan,  making  allowance  to  policyholders  who  have  continuously for  a 
specified  period  made  premium  payments  directly  to  an  office  of  the 
insurer  in  an  amount  that  fairly  represents  the  saving  in  collection 
expenses; or

(iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy 
based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first 
or  any subsequent  policy year  of  insurance  thereunder,  which  may be 
made retroactive only for such policy year.

(9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement 
practice if  any of  the following or any rules  and regulations pertaining 
thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such 
provisions,  or  committed  with  such  frequency as  to  indicate  a  general 
business practice:

(a) Misrepresenting  pertinent  facts  or  insurance  policy  provisions 
relating to coverages at issue;

(b) failing  to  acknowledge  and  act  reasonably  promptly  upon 
communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;

(c) failing  to  adopt  and  implement  reasonable  standards  for  the 
prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies;

(d) refusing  to  pay  claims  without  conducting  a  reasonable 
investigation based upon all available information;

the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by 
the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under 
penalty of  perjury,  stating the percent  of  closed  title  orders  originating 
from controlled business.  The failure of  a  title  insurer  or  title  agent  to 
comply  with  the  requirements  of  this  section,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
commissioner,  shall  be  grounds  for  the  suspension  or  revocation  of  a 
license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate 
any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be 
in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal 
housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.

(i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance 
order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it  knows or has 
reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of 
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the 
associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent 
to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing 
to the person so referred the fact  that such producer or associate has a 
financial  interest  in  the  title  insurer  or  title  agent,  the  nature  of  the 
financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges 
generally made by the title  insurer  or  agent  for  the title services.  Such 
disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated 
to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate 
has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers 
of  not  less  than  three  other  title  insurers  or  agents  that  operate  in  the 
county in which the property is  located.  If  fewer than three insurers or 
agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers 
or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed 
by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment 
having been made to such title insurer or agent.

(2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall 
require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any 
other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,

kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial

interest in such title agent or title insurer.
(3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order 

or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to 
believe that  the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales 
contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.

(4) Nothing  in  this  paragraph  shall  prohibit  any  producer  of  title 
business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any 
title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if 
such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in 
the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or 
realized from such financial interest, so long as:

(a) Such financial  interest  is  disclosed to the purchaser of the title 
insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);

(b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for 
the referral of business; and

(c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return 
on the investment of the producer or associate.

(5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who 
violates  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  (i)(2)  through  (i)(4),  or  any  title 
insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that 
it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other 
action  that  may  be  taken  by  the  commissioner  of  insurance,  shall  be 
subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the 
premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034 
et  seq.,  and amendments thereto,  shall be deemed to have committed a 
prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and 
shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal 
to the premium for the title insurance.

(6) Any title  insurer  or  title  agent  that  is  a competitor of  any title 
insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has 
violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause 
of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the 
existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition 
to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or 
injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this 
subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of 
the action together with reasonable attorney fees.

(7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide 
core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.

(j) The commissioner shall adopt any regulations necessary to carry 
out the provisions of this act.

(15) Disclosure  of  nonpublic  personal  information. (a)  No  person 
shall  disclose  any  nonpublic  personal  information  contrary  to  the

commissioners  entitled  "Privacy  of  consumer  financial  and  health 
information regulation".

(b) Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  be  deemed  or  construed  to 
authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that  preempts, 
supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning 
requirements  for  notification  of,  or  obtaining  consent  from,  a  parent, 
guardian  or  other  legal  custodian  of  a  minor  relating  to  any  matter 
pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.

of  K.S.A.  75-4232,  and  amendments  thereto,  in  designating  banks  to 
receive  deposit  of  state  moneys  in  operating  accounts  and  investment 
accounts.  The  board  shall  determine  which  banks  shall  receive  state 
operating  and  investment  accounts  and  shall  designate  the  types  of 
accounts to be awarded each such bank and the initial  amount of  each 
award. Such initial awards which are operating accounts shall be made as 
provided in K.S.A. 75-4205, and amendments thereto. Such initial awards 
which are investment accounts shall be awarded as is provided in K.S.A. 
75-4209, and amendments thereto. Upon making the awards provided for 
above, the board shall notify each bank of its award, and that the same is 
subject to approval of securities to be pledged as prescribed in this act.

(b) The board shall not designate a bank to receive deposit of state  
moneys in operating  accounts or investment accounts if  such bank has  
been listed by the state treasurer as a restricted  financial institution as  
provided in section 15, and amendments thereto. Any agreement awarding

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

Preamble 19 

 

 WHEREAS, The General Assembly finds that there are two biological sexes, female 20

 WHEREAS, There are “[i]nherent differences between men and women,” and that 1 

these differences “remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of 2

chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological differences; and 6 

 

 WHEREAS, Men generally have “denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments” 7

and 11 

 

 WHEREAS, Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits 12 

such as hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the 13 

development of Type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate 14

 WHEREAS, While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme 25 

Court has recognized that “sex classifications may be used to compensate women for 26 

particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment 27 

opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s 28 

people.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (internal citations and 29 

quotation marks omitted); and 30 

 

 WHEREAS, One place where sex classifications allow for the “full development of 31 

the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people” is in the context of sports and athletics; 32 

and 33 

 

 WHEREAS, Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences 34 

between males and females result in different athletic capabilities. See, e.g., Kleczek v. 35 

Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (“Because of innate 36 

physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic 37 

competition.”); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass’n, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting 38 

that “high school boys [generally possess physiological advantages over] their girl 39 



 HOUSE BILL 359 3 

 

 

counterparts” and that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports 1 

like “high school track”); and 2 

 

 WHEREAS, A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 3 

found that, although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the “gender 4 

gap” between female and male performances remained stable. “These suggest that women’s 5 

performances at the high level will never match those of men.” Valerie Thibault, et al., 6 

Women and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 7 

Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010); and 8 

 

 WHEREAS, As Duke Law professor and All–American track athlete Doriane 9 

Coleman, tennis champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya 10 

Richards–Ross recently wrote: “The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in 11 

every sport except sailing, shooting and riding, there will always be significant numbers of 12 

boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head–to–head competition. 13 

Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science.” Doriane Coleman, Martina 14 

Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don’t Abandon Title IX, WASHINGTON 15 

POST (Apr. 29, 2019), https://wapo.st/2VKlNN1; and 16 

 

 WHEREAS, The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes are not 17 

diminished through the use of puberty blockers and cross–sex hormones. A recent study on 18 

the impact of such treatments found that policies like those of the International Olympic 19 

Committee that require biological males to undergo at least one year of testosterone 20 

suppression before competing in women’s sports do not create a level playing field. “[T]he 21 

reduction in testosterone levels required by many sports federation transgender policies is 22 

insufficient to remove or reduce the male advantage by any meaningful degree.” For 23 

example, “the muscle mass advantage males possess over females, and potentially the 24 

performance implications thereof, are not removed by 12 months of testosterone 25 

suppression.” Instead, the study concluded that “The data presented here demonstrates 26 

that the male physical performance advantage over females, attributed to superior 27 

anthropometric and muscle mass/strength parameters achieved at puberty, is not removed 28 

by the current regimen of testosterone suppression permitting participation of transgender 29 

women in female sports categories. Rather, it appears that the male performance 30 

advantage is largely retained by transgender women and thus remains substantial.” 31

Male Performance Advantage Removed by Testosterone Suppression?. Preprints 2020, 33 

2020050226 (doi: 10.20944/preprints202005.0226.v1); and 34 

 

 WHEREAS, Having separate sex–specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex 35 

equality. Sex–specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes 36 

to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with 37 

opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous 38 

other long–term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors; now, therefore, 39

FIRST REGULAR SESSION 

SENATE BILL NO. 39 
102ND GENERAL ASSEMBLY  

INTRODUCED BY SENATOR THOMPSON REHDER. 

0815S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary  

AN ACT 

To amend chapter 163, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to participation in 

athletic competition. 
 

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows: 

     Section A.  Chapter 163, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto 1 

one new section, to be known as section 163.048, to read as 2 

follows:3 

     163.048.  1.  As used in this section, the following  1 

terms mean: 2 

     (1)  "Athletics", any interscholastic athletic games,  3 

contests, programs, activities, exhibitions, or other  4 

similar competitions organized and provided for students; 5 

     (2)  "Sex", the two main categories of male and female  6 

into which individuals are divided based on an individual's  7 

reproductive biology at birth and the individual's genome. 8 

     2.  (1)  The general assembly hereby finds the  9 

following: 10 

     (a)  A noticeable disparity continues between the  11 

athletics participation rates of students who are male and  12 

students who are female; 13 

     (b)  Courts have recognized a legitimate and important  14 

governmental interest in redressing past discrimination  15 

against females in athletics on the basis of sex and  16 

promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the sexes  17 



 SB 39 2 

under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972  18 

(20 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq.), as amended; and 19 

     (c)  Courts have recognized that classification by sex  20 

is the only feasible classification to promote the  21 

governmental interest of providing opportunities for  22 

athletics for females. 23 

     (2)  The general assembly hereby declares that it is  24 

the public policy of this state to further the governmental  25 

interest of ensuring that sufficient opportunities for  26 

athletics remain available for females to remedy past  27 

discrimination on the basis of sex. 28 

     3.  (1)  Except as provided under subdivision (2) of  29 

this subsection, no school district or charter school shall  30 

allow any student to compete in an athletics competition  31 

that is designated for the biological sex opposite to the  32 

student's biological sex as correctly stated on the  33 

student's official birth certificate as described in  34 

subsection 4 of this section or, if the student's official  35 

birth certificate is unobtainable, another government record. 36 

     (2)  A school district or charter school may allow a  37 

female student to compete in an athletics competition that  38 

is designated for male students if no corresponding  39 

athletics competition designated for female students is  40 

offered or available. 41 

     4.  For purposes of this section, a statement of a  42 

student's biological sex on the student's official birth  43 

certificate or another government record shall be deemed to  44 

have correctly stated the student's biological sex only if  45 

the statement was: 46 

     (1)  Entered at or near the time of the student's  47 

birth; or 48 



 SB 39 3 

     (2)  Modified to correct any scrivener's error in the  49 

student's biological sex. 50 

     5.  No school district or charter school that violates  51 

subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section shall  52 

receive any state aid under this chapter or any other  53 

revenues from the state. 54 

     6.  The department of elementary and secondary  55 

education shall promulgate all necessary rules and  56 

regulations for the implementation and administration of  57 

this section.  Such rules and regulations shall ensure  58 

compliance with state and federal law regarding the  59 

confidentiality of student medical information.  Any rule or  60 

portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section  61 

536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in  62 

this section shall become effective only if it complies with  63 

and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and,  64 

if applicable, section 536.028.  This section and chapter  65 

536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with  66 

the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to  67 

delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule  68 

are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of  69 

rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after  70 

August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void. 71

A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to health care; to adopt the Medical Ethics1

and Diversity Act; and to provide severability.2

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

nurses, allied health professionals, paraprofessionals, or contractors or31

employees of health care institutions;1

(7) Medical practitioner means any person or individual who may be2

or is asked to participate in any way in any health care service. The3

physician's assistants, nurses, nurses' aides, allied health5

professionals, medical assistants, hospital employees, clinic employees,6

nursing home employees, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and employees,7

(8) Participate in a health care service means to provide, perform,13

assist with, facilitate, direct, refer for, counsel for, advise with14

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

institution shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for11

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

directly or indirectly perform, facilitate, or participate in an28

abortion, as defined in section 71-6901 unless the practitioner first29

affirmatively consents in writing to perform, facilitate, or participate30

in the abortion.31

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

Sec. 5.  (1) No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against5

in any manner because the medical practitioner:6

(a) Provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause7

to be provided to such practitioner's employer, the Attorney General, the8

Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, any other state agency9

charged with protecting health care rights of conscience, the Office for10

Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human11

Services, or any other federal agency charged with protecting health care12

rights of conscience information relating to any violation of, or any act13

or omission the medical practitioner reasonably believes to be a14

violation of, any provision of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act;15

(b) Testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning such16

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

(2) Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no20

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner because21

the medical practitioner disclosed any information that the medical22

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of27

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or28

safety.29

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

a medical practitioner with any complaints it has received which may12

result in the revocation of the medical practitioner's license,13

certification, or registration within fourteen days after receipt of the14

complaint.15

(b) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or16

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must pay the17

medical practitioner an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars18

for each day the complaint is not provided to the medical practitioner19

after the specified fourteen days.20

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

RELATING TO PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS;2

AMENDING TITLE 33, IDAHO CODE, BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW CHAPTER 66, TITLE3
33, IDAHO CODE, TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS, TO DEFINE TERMS, TO ES-4
TABLISH PROVISIONS REGARDING SCHOOL RESTROOMS, TO PROVIDE EXEMPTIONS,5
TO PROVIDE FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, TO PRO-6
VIDE FOR A CIVIL CAUSE OF ACTION, AND TO PROVIDE FOR PREEMPTION; PROVID-7
ING SEVERABILITY; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE8
DATE.9

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:10

SECTION 1. That Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended11
by the addition thereto of a NEW CHAPTER, to be known and designated as Chap-12
ter 66, Title 33, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:13

CHAPTER 6614
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS15

33-6601. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that:16
(1) There are real and inherent physical differences between men and17

women;18
(2) Every person has a natural right to privacy and safety in restrooms19

and changing facilities where such person might be in a partial or full state20
of undress in the presence of others;21

(3) This natural right especially applies to students using public22
school restrooms and changing facilities where student privacy and safety is23
essential to providing a safe learning environment for all students;24

(4) Requiring students to share restrooms and changing facilities with25
members of the opposite biological sex generates potential embarrassment,26
shame, and psychological injury to students, as well as increasing the like-27
lihood of sexual assault, molestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism;28

(5) Providing separate public school restrooms and changing facilities29
for the different biological sexes is a long-standing and widespread prac-30
tice protected by federal law, state law, and case law;31

(6) Federal legislative action, federal executive action, and fed-32
eral court judgments that prevent public schools from maintaining separate33
restrooms and changing facilities for different biological sexes are in-34
consistent with the United States constitution and violate the privacy and35
safety rights of students; and36

(7) A statewide policy ensuring separate school restrooms and chang-37
ing facilities on the basis of biological sex is substantially related to the38
important governmental interest in protecting the privacy and safety of all39
students.40



2

33-6602. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this chapter:1
(1) "Changing facility" means a facility in which a person may be in a2

(b) Used only by members of that sex.14
(2) No person shall enter a multi-occupancy restroom or changing facil-15

ity that is designated for one sex unless such person is a member of that sex.16
The public school with authority over the building shall ensure that all re-17
strooms and changing facilities provide its users with privacy from members18
of the opposite sex.19

(3) In any other public school setting where a person may be in a state20
of undress in the presence of others, school personnel must provide separate21
and private areas designated for use by persons based on their sex, and no22
person may enter these private areas unless such person is a member of the23
designated sex.24

(4) During any school authorized activity or event where persons share25
overnight lodging, school personnel must provide separate sleeping quar-26
ters for members of each sex. No person shall share sleeping quarters, a27
restroom, or a changing facility with a person of the opposite sex, unless28
the persons are members of the same family.29

33-6604. EXEMPTIONS. This chapter shall not apply:30
(1) To single-occupancy restrooms and changing facilities or restrooms31

the opposite sex, if such single-sex facility is the only facility reason-37
ably available at the time of the person's use of the facility;38

(4) To a person employed to clean, maintain, or inspect a restroom or39
single-sex facility;40

(5) To a person who enters a restroom or facility to render medical as-41
sistance;42

of receiving that assistance, is accompanied by a family member, a legal44
guardian, or the person's designee who is a member of the designated sex for45
the single-sex restroom or changing facility; or46

(7) During an ongoing natural disaster or emergency, or when necessary47
to prevent a serious threat to good order or student safety.48



3

33-6605. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. (1) A public school shall provide1
a reasonable accommodation to a student who:2

designated for use by aggrieved student's sex. The student may also recover27
monetary damages from the defendant public school for all psychological,28
emotional, and physical harm suffered.29

(4) Any student who prevails in action brought under this chapter is en-30

public school.32

(5) Nothing in this chapter limits other remedies at law or equity33

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13 

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Fairness in Women's Sports Act". 14 

16-112-2. Designation of athletic teams. 15 

Interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports that are 16 

sponsored by a public school or any public school district activities association or a public 17 

institution of higher education or any higher education institution that is a member of the national 18 

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19 

national junior college athletic association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one of the 20 

following based on biological sex: 21 

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25 

students of the male sex. 26 

(ii) If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement 27 

that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: 28 

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; 29 

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and 30 

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup. 31 

16-112-3. Protection for educational institutions.   32 

A government entity, any licensing or accrediting organization, or any athletic association 33 

or organization shall not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse 34

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

communication of messages.

(2) The board shall have the responsibility for the management of the 
fund and shall discharge the board's duties with respect to the fund solely 
in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the system for the 
exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and such member's 
beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the fund 
and  shall  invest  and  reinvest  moneys  in  the  fund  and  acquire,  retain, 
manage,  including  the  exercise  of  any  voting  rights  and  disposal  of 
investments of the fund within the limitations and according to the powers, 
duties and purposes as prescribed by this section.

(3) Moneys in the fund shall be invested and reinvested to achieve the 
investment objective which is preservation of the fund to provide benefits 
to members and member beneficiaries, as provided by law and accordingly 
providing that  the moneys  are as  productive as  possible,  subject  to the 
standards set forth in this act. No moneys in the fund shall be invested or 
reinvested if the sole or primary an investment objective is for economic 
development or social purposes or objectives.

(4) In investing and reinvesting moneys in the fund and in acquiring, 
retaining, managing and disposing of investments of the fund, the board 
shall exercise the judgment, care, skill, prudence and diligence under the 
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and 
intelligence acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would 
use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims by 
diversifying the investments of the fund so as to minimize the risk of large 
losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, 
and not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition 
of similar funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable 
safety of their capital.

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4): 
(a) Total investments in common stock may be made in the amount of 

up to 60% of the total book value of the fund;
(b) the board may invest or reinvest moneys of the fund in alternative

(ii) if in addition to the system, there are at least two other qualified 
institutional buyers, as defined by section (a)(1)(i) of rule 144A, securities 
act of 1933;

(iv) the  system  has  received  a  favorable  and  appropriate 
recommendation  from  a  qualified,  independent  expert  in  investment 
management or analysis in that particular type of alternative investment;

(v) the  alternative  investment  is  consistent  with  the  system's 
investment policies and objectives as provided in subsection (6);

(vi) the individual alternative investment does not exceed more than 
2.5% of the total alternative investments made under this subsection. If the 
alternative investment is made pursuant to participation by the system in a 
multi-investor  pool,  the  2.5% limitation contained  in  this  subsection is 
applied  to  the  underlying  individual  assets  of  such  pool  and  not  to 
investment  in  the  pool  itself.  The  total  of  such  alternative  investments 
made pursuant to participation by the system in any one individual multi-
investor pool shall not exceed more than 20% of the total of alternative 
investments made by the system pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in 
this subsection requires the board to liquidate or sell the system's holdings 
in  any  alternative  investments  made  pursuant  to  participation  by  the 
system in any one individual multi-investor pool held by the system on the 
effective date of this act, unless such liquidation or sale would be in the 
best  interest  of  the  members  and  beneficiaries  of  the  system  and  be 
prudent under the standards contained in this section. The 20% limitation 
contained in this subsection shall not have been violated if the total of such 
investment in any one individual multi-investor pool exceeds 20% of the 
total alternative investments of the fund as a result of market forces acting 
to increase the value of such a multi-investor pool relative to the rest of the 
system's  alternative investments;  however,  the board shall  not  invest  or 
reinvest any moneys of the fund in any such individual multi-investor pool 
until the value of such individual multi-investor pool is less than 20% of 
the total alternative investments of the fund;

(vii) the board has received and considered the investment manager's 
due diligence findings submitted to the board as required by subsection (6)
(c) (6);

(viii) prior to the time the alternative investment is made, the system 
has  in  place  procedures  and  systems  to  ensure  that  the  investment  is 
properly monitored and investment performance is accurately measured; 
and

(ix) the total of alternative investments does not exceed 15% of the 
total investment assets of the fund. The 15% limitation contained in this 
subsection  shall  not  have  been  violated  if  the  total  of  such  alternative 
investments exceeds 15% of the total investment assets of the fund, based 
on  the  fund  total  market  value,  as  a  result  of  market  forces  acting  to 
increase the value of such alternative investments relative to the rest of the 
system's investments. However, the board shall not invest or reinvest any 
moneys of the fund in alternative investments until the total value of such

alternative investments is less than 15% of the total investment assets of 
the fund based on the market value. If  the total value of the alternative 
investments exceeds 15% of the total investment assets of the fund, the 
board shall not be required to liquidate or sell the system's holdings in any 
alternative investment held by the system, unless such liquidation or sale 
would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  members  and  beneficiaries  of  the 
system and is prudent under the standards contained in this section.;

(c) for purposes of this act section, "alternative investment" includes 
a broad group of investments that are not one of the traditional asset types 
of  public  equities,  fixed  income,  cash  or  real  estate.  Alternative 
investments  are  generally  made  through  limited  partnership  or  similar 
structures, are not regularly traded on nationally recognized exchanges and 
thus are relatively illiquid, and exhibit lower correlations with more liquid 
asset  types such as stocks and bonds. Alternative investments generally 
include, but are not limited to, private equity, private credit, hedge funds, 
infrastructure,  commodities  and  other  investments which that have  the

recommendation  from  a  qualified,  independent  expert  in  investment 
management or analysis in that particular type of real estate investment;

(ii) the  real  estate  investment  is  consistent  with  the  system's 
investment policies and objectives as provided in subsection (6); and

(iii) the system has received and considered the investment manager's 
due diligence findings.

(6) (a) Subject  to  the objective set  forth  in subsection (3)  and the 
standards set  forth  in subsections (4)  and (5)  the board shall  formulate 
policies and objectives for the investment and reinvestment of moneys in 
the  fund  and  the  acquisition,  retention,  management  and  disposition of 
investments of the fund. Such policies and objectives shall include:

(a)(i) Specific asset allocation standards and objectives;
(b)(ii) establishment  of  criteria  for  evaluating  the  risk  versus  the 

potential return on a particular investment;
(c)(iii) a  requirement  that  all  investment  managers  submit  such 

manager's  due  diligence  findings  on  each  investment  to  the  board  or 
investment advisory committee for approval or rejection prior to making 
any alternative investment;

(d)(iv) a requirement that all investment managers shall immediately 
report all instances of default on investments to the board and provide the 
board with recommendations and options, including, but not  limited to, 
curing the default or withdrawal from the investment; and

determining  when  no  additional  add-on  investments  or  reinvestments 
would be made and when the investment would be liquidated.

(b) The  board  shall  review  such  policies  and  objectives,  make 
changes considered necessary or desirable and readopt such policies and 
objectives on an annual basis.

(7) The  board  may enter  into  contracts  with  one  or  more  persons 
whom the board determines to be qualified, whereby the persons undertake 
to perform the functions specified in subsection (2) to the extent provided 
in the contract. Performance of functions under contract so entered into 
shall be paid pursuant to rates fixed by the board subject to provisions of 
appropriation  acts  and  shall  be  based  on  specific  contractual  fee 
arrangements.  The  system shall  not  pay or  reimburse  any  expenses  of 
persons  contracted  with  pursuant  to  this  subsection,  except  that  after 
approval of the board, the system may pay approved investment related 
expenses  subject  to  provisions  of  appropriation  acts.  The  board  shall 
require  that  a  person  contracted  with  to  obtain  commercial  insurance 
which provides for errors and omissions coverage for such person in an 
amount to be specified by the board, provided that such coverage shall be 
at least the greater of $500,000 or 1% of the funds entrusted to such person 
up  to  a  maximum  of  $10,000,000.  The  board  shall  require  a  person 
contracted with to give a fidelity bond in a penal sum as may be fixed by 
law or, if not so fixed, as may be fixed by the board, with corporate surety 
authorized to do business in this state. Such persons contracted with the 
board pursuant to this subsection and any persons contracted with such 
persons  to  perform  the  functions  specified  in  subsection  (2)  shall  be 
deemed to be agents of the board and the system in the performance of 
contractual obligations.

(8) (a) In the acquisition or disposition of securities, the board may 
rely on the written legal opinion of a reputable bond attorney or attorneys, 
the  written  opinion  of  the  attorney  of  the  investment  counselor  or 
managers,  or  the  written  opinion of  the  attorney general  certifying the 
legality of the securities.

(b) The board shall employ or retain qualified investment counsel or 
counselors or may negotiate with a trust company to assist and advise in 
the judicious investment of funds as herein provided.

(9) (a) Except as provided in subsection (7) and this subsection, the 
custody of money and securities of the fund shall remain in the custody of 
the state treasurer, except that the board may arrange for the custody of 
such  money and  securities  as  it  considers  advisable  with  one  or  more 
member banks or trust companies of the federal reserve system or with one 
or more banks in the state of Kansas, or both, to be held in safekeeping by 
the banks or trust companies for the collection of the principal and interest

(10) The board shall with the advice of the director of accounts and 
reports establish the requirements and procedure for reporting any and all 
activity relating to investment functions provided for in this act in order to 
prepare a  record monthly of  the investment  income and changes made 
during the preceding month. The record will reflect a detailed summary of

true accounting of the investment activity of the fund.

(11) The board shall  provide for  an examination of the investment

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23 

(3) Coed or mixed. 24 

(i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to 25

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; 29 

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and 30 

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup. 31 

16-112-3. Protection for educational institutions.   32

or organization shall not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 4 of 5 

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3 

(a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect 4 

harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive 5 

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6 

education. 7 

(b) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, institution 8

chapter to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or 10 

organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher 11 

education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any 12 

other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or 13 

organization. 14 

(c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as 15 

a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, 16

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

shall not substantially burden the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing, 

education, health care, and mental health of that parent's child without demonstrating

applied to the parent and the child and is the least restrictive means of furthering that 

compelling governmental interest. 

 36-8-104.  Parental rights and responsibilities. 

 (a)  All parental rights are exclusively reserved to a parent of a child without 

obstruction by or interference from this state, a political subdivision of this state, another

subdivision of this state, another governmental entity, or any other institution 

suspects that abuse, neglect, or a criminal offense has been committed against

reported to law enforcement and notification of the parent would impede a law 

enforcement or department of children's services investigation. 

 (b)  This chapter does not: 

 (1)  Authorize or allow a parent to abuse or neglect a child; 

 (2)  Apply to a parental action or decision that would end life; or

 (b)  A local board of education or the governing body of a public charter school 

may adopt a policy to provide to parents the information required by this section in an 

electronic form. 

 (c)  Notwithstanding title 49, a parent shall submit a written or electronic request 

for information pursuant to this section to either the school principal or the director of 

schools.  Within ten (10) days of receiving the request for information, the school

information, then the parent may submit a written request for the information to the local 

board of education or the governing body of a public charter school, which shall formally 

consider the request at the next scheduled public meeting of the board or governing 

body if the request can be properly noticed on the agenda.  If the request cannot be 

properly noticed on the agenda, the local board of education or the governing body of a

unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter.

requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.

can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of 

this act are severable.

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

AMENDING TITLE 33, IDAHO CODE, BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW CHAPTER 66, TITLE3
33, IDAHO CODE, TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS, TO DEFINE TERMS, TO ES-4

ING SEVERABILITY; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE8
DATE.9

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:10

SECTION 1. That Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended11
by the addition thereto of a NEW CHAPTER, to be known and designated as Chap-12
ter 66, Title 33, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:13

CHAPTER 6614
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS15

33-6601. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that:16
(1) There are real and inherent physical differences between men and17

women;18
(2) Every person has a natural right to privacy and safety in restrooms19

and changing facilities where such person might be in a partial or full state20
of undress in the presence of others;21

(3) This natural right especially applies to students using public22
school restrooms and changing facilities where student privacy and safety is23
essential to providing a safe learning environment for all students;24

(4) Requiring students to share restrooms and changing facilities with25
members of the opposite biological sex generates potential embarrassment,26
shame, and psychological injury to students, as well as increasing the like-27
lihood of sexual assault, molestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism;28

(5) Providing separate public school restrooms and changing facilities29
for the different biological sexes is a long-standing and widespread prac-30
tice protected by federal law, state law, and case law;31

(6) Federal legislative action, federal executive action, and fed-32
eral court judgments that prevent public schools from maintaining separate33
restrooms and changing facilities for different biological sexes are in-34
consistent with the United States constitution and violate the privacy and35
safety rights of students; and36

(7) A statewide policy ensuring separate school restrooms and chang-37
ing facilities on the basis of biological sex is substantially related to the38
important governmental interest in protecting the privacy and safety of all39
students.40



2

33-6602. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this chapter:1
(1) "Changing facility" means a facility in which a person may be in a2

room, or shower room.4

(2) "Public school" means any public school teaching K-12 students5
within an Idaho school district or charter school.6

(2) No person shall enter a multi-occupancy restroom or changing facil-15

ity that is designated for one sex unless such person is a member of that sex.16
The public school with authority over the building shall ensure that all re-17
strooms and changing facilities provide its users with privacy from members18
of the opposite sex.19

(3) In any other public school setting where a person may be in a state20
of undress in the presence of others, school personnel must provide separate21
and private areas designated for use by persons based on their sex, and no22
person may enter these private areas unless such person is a member of the23
designated sex.24

(4) During any school authorized activity or event where persons share25
overnight lodging, school personnel must provide separate sleeping quar-26
ters for members of each sex. No person shall share sleeping quarters, a27
restroom, or a changing facility with a person of the opposite sex, unless28
the persons are members of the same family.29

33-6604. EXEMPTIONS. This chapter shall not apply:30
(1) To single-occupancy restrooms and changing facilities or restrooms31

ily use;33

(2) To restrooms and changing facilities that have been temporarily34
designated for use by that person's biological sex;35

the opposite sex, if such single-sex facility is the only facility reason-37
ably available at the time of the person's use of the facility;38

(4) To a person employed to clean, maintain, or inspect a restroom or39
single-sex facility;40

(5) To a person who enters a restroom or facility to render medical as-41
sistance;42

guardian, or the person's designee who is a member of the designated sex for45
the single-sex restroom or changing facility; or46

(7) During an ongoing natural disaster or emergency, or when necessary47
to prevent a serious threat to good order or student safety.48



3

33-6605. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. (1) A public school shall provide1
a reasonable accommodation to a student who:2

each instance that the student encountered a person of the opposite sex while25
accessing a public school restroom, changing facility, or sleeping quarters26
designated for use by aggrieved student's sex. The student may also recover27
monetary damages from the defendant public school for all psychological,28
emotional, and physical harm suffered.29

(4) Any student who prevails in action brought under this chapter is en-30
titled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs from the defendant31
public school.32

(5) Nothing in this chapter limits other remedies at law or equity33
available to the aggrieved student against the school.34

33-6607. PREEMPTION. This chapter preempts any law, regulation, pol-35

TIES -- DEFINITION. (1) Except as provided in subsection (4)(3) of this14
section, whoever knowingly authorizes or commits any procedure that circum-15
cises, excises, or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora,16
labia minora, or clitoris of a child shall be guilty of a felony.17

(2) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, whoever know-18

lation of this section if the operation or intervention is:5
(a) Necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed and is6
performed by a person licensed in the place of its performance as a med-7
ical practitioner, except that a medical intervention that results in8
the impairment and mutilation of the reproductive organs and parts of a9
child is never necessary to the health of the child on whom it is per-10
formed if it is for the sole purpose of attempting to alter the appear-11
ance of or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex if that per-12
ception is inconsistent with the child's biological sex; or13
(b) Performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth and is14

(4) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to18

a person acting in accordance with the good faith medical decision of a par-19
ent or guardian of a child born with a medically verifiable genetic disorder20
of sex development, including:21

(a) A child with external biological sex characteristics that are am-22
biguous and irresolvable, such as a child born having 46, XX chromosomes23
with virilization, 46, XY chromosomes with undervirilization, or with24
both ovarian and testicular tissue;25
(b) When a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual de-26

steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a male or29
female; or30
(c) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that31
has been caused or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition32
procedures, whether or not the procedures were performed in accordance33
with state and federal law.34
(5) In applying subsection (4)(3)(a) of this section, no account shall35

be taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to be performed36

tion is required as a matter of custom or ritual.38

(6) Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be guilty39
of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not more40
than life ten (10) years.41

(7) For the purposes of this section, "child" means any person under42
eighteen (18) years of age.43

(8) For the purposes of this section, "sex" means the immutable biolog-44
ical and physiological characteristics, specifically the chromosomes and45
internal and external reproductive anatomy, genetically determined at con-46

(9) The provisions of this act are hereby declared to be severable,49
and if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any50



3

person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration1
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this section.2

(10) The legislature finds and declares that:3
(a) Biological sex is an objectively defined category that has obvious,4
immutable, and distinguishable characteristics.5
(b) Gender dysphoria among children rarely persists into adulthood,6
with peer-reviewed research revealing that as many as ninety-eight per-7
cent (98%) of gender dysphoric boys and as many as eighty-eight percent8
(88%) of gender dysphoric girls ultimately identify with their biologi-9
cal sex after passing through puberty.10
(c) Some healthcare providers now routinely administer puberty block-11
ers to prepubescent and pubescent children notwithstanding scientific12
evidence that children who remain on puberty blockers may never recover13
lost development and despite known sterility and additional concerns14
about reduced IQ and future osteoporosis.15
(d) Some healthcare providers now routinely administer cross-sex hor-16
mones to pubescent children notwithstanding scientific evidence that17
such therapies cause irreversible sterility and likely increase risks18
of other medical conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease,19
blood clots, osteoporosis, and obesity.20
(e) Some healthcare providers now refer pubescent adolescents for sex21
reassignment surgeries that permanently mutilate healthy reproductive22
organs and other body parts.23
(f) The world professional association for transgender health, a pro-24
fessional organization that publishes the standards of care for treat-25
ing gender dysphoria, has altogether removed its age recommendations26
for adolescent sex reassignment surgeries, including but not limited to27
surgical castration, mastectomies, hysterectomies, and genital recon-28
struction, despite the known harms and experimental nature of perform-29
ing such surgeries on gender dysphoric children.30
(g) Recent science suggests that medical interventions like surgeries31
and cross-sex hormones do not significantly improve long-term health32
outcomes for patients struggling with gender dysphoria and that suicide33
rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly34
elevated above the background population after inpatient gender reas-35
signment procedures have been performed.36
(h) No long-term randomized studies evaluate the efficacy or safety of37
the use of puberty blockers for the purpose of treating gender dyspho-38
ria, and no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the effi-39
cacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for40
the purpose of treating gender dysphoria.41
(i) These experimental, irreversible, and medically unnecessary phar-42
maceutical and surgical interventions violate the Hippocratic oath,43
taken by physicians for millennia, to "do no harm."44
(j) Therefore, the state of Idaho has a compelling government interest45
in protecting the health and safety of its minor children from such med-46
ical interventions for the purpose of attempting to affirm or change a47
child's gender expression.48

SECTION 2. That Section 19-5307, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby49
amended to read as follows:50



4

19-5307. FINES IN CASES OF CRIMES OF VIOLENCE. (1) Irrespective of any1
penalties set forth under state law, and in addition thereto, the court, at2
the time of sentencing or such later date as deemed necessary by the court,3
may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) against any4
defendant found guilty of any felony listed in subsections (2) and (3) of5
this section.6

The fine shall operate as a civil judgment against the defendant and7
shall be entered on behalf of the victim named in the indictment or infor-8
mation, or the family of the victim in cases of homicide or crimes against9
children, and shall not be subject to any distribution otherwise required10
in section 19-4705, Idaho Code. The clerk of the district court may collect11
the fine in the same manner as other fines imposed in criminal cases are12
collected and shall remit any money collected in payment of the fine to the13
victim named in the indictment or information or to the family of the victim14

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

employees of health care institutions;1

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

LB810
2023

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

directly or indirectly perform, facilitate, or participate in an28

in the abortion.31

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

(2) Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no20

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner because21

the medical practitioner disclosed any information that the medical22

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of27

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or28

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

Committee on the Judiciary 

RESOLUTION 
Establishing a Women’s Bill of Rights to reaffirm legal 

protections afforded to women under Federal law. 

Whereas males and females possess unique and immutable bi-

ological differences that manifest prior to birth and in-

crease as they age and experience puberty; 

Whereas biological differences between the sexes mean that 

only females may get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed 

children; 

Whereas biological differences between the sexes mean that 

males are, on average, larger in size and possess greater 

body strength than females;

•HRES 115 IH 

Whereas biological differences between the sexes can expose 

females to more harm than males from specific forms of 

violence, including sexual violence; 

Whereas women have achieved inspirational and significant 

accomplishments in education, athletics, and employment; 

and 

Whereas recent misguided court rulings related to the defini-

tion of ‘‘sex’’ have led to endangerment of spaces and re-

sources dedicated to women, thereby necessitating clari-

fication of certain terms: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the House of Representatives reaf-1

firms that— 2

(1) for purposes of Federal law, a person’s 3

‘‘sex’’ means his or her biological sex (either male or 4

female) at birth; 5

(2) for purposes of Federal law addressing sex, 6

the terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘girl’’ refer to human fe-7

males, and the terms ‘‘man’’ and ‘‘boy’’ refer to 8

human males; 9

(3) for purposes of Federal law, the word 10

‘‘mother’’ means a parent of the female sex and ‘‘fa-11

ther’’ is defined as a parent of the male sex; 12

(4) there are important reasons to distinguish 13

between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, 14

domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and other 15

areas, particularly where biology, safety, and privacy 16

are implicated; 17

(5) policies and laws that distinguish between 1

the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional 2

scrutiny and permitted when they serve an impor-3

tant governmental objective and are substantially re-4

lated to achieving that objective; and 5

(6) for purposes of complying with Federal laws 6

that require State and local government agencies to 7

collect or report data disaggregated by sex, such as 8

Federal antidiscrimination laws, agencies are re-9

quired to base such data on the biological sex of in-10

dividuals at birth. 11

and Diversity Act; and to provide severability.2

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

employees of health care institutions;1

nursing home employees, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and employees,7

or participates in the provision of health care services to any person;12

(8) Participate in a health care service means to provide, perform,13

assist with, facilitate, direct, refer for, counsel for, advise with14

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

institution shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for11

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

directly or indirectly perform, facilitate, or participate in an28

in the abortion.31

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

Sec. 5.  (1) No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against5

in any manner because the medical practitioner:6

(a) Provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause7

violation of, any provision of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act;15

(b) Testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning such16

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

(2) Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no20

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner because21

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of27

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or28

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

result in the revocation of the medical practitioner's license,13

certification, or registration within fourteen days after receipt of the14

complaint.15

(b) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or16

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must pay the17

medical practitioner an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars18

for each day the complaint is not provided to the medical practitioner19

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

By: Senators Dixon of the 45th, Gooch of the 51st, Harbin of the 16th, Robertson of the 29th,

Still of the 48th and others 

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

AN ACT

To amend Chapter 1 of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to1

general provisions relative to professions and businesses, so as to prohibit health care2

providers from performing specified practices on minors relating to altering a person's3

appearance relating to gender; to prohibit health care providers from aiding or abetting such4

practices for minors; to provide for definitions; to provide for exceptions; to provide for5

enforcement; to amend Part 3 of Article 16 of Chapter 2 of Title 20 of the Official Code of6

Georgia Annotated, relating to student health, so as to prohibit school nurses and other7

employees and officials from engaging in certain conduct relating to a minor's perception of8

his or her gender; to provide for legislative findings; to provide for related matters; to provide9

for an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.10

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:11

SECTION 1.12

The General Assembly finds and declares that:13

(1)  This state has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of14

its citizens, especially vulnerable children;15



23 LC 33 9320

S. B. 141
- 2 -

(2)  Only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying16

with their biological sex.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence17

ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent18

for natal females;19

(3)  Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender20

nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to21

identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most22

medical health care interventions unnecessary;23

(4)  Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their24

biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these25

individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services before undertaking26

any hormonal or surgical intervention;27

(5)  Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated28

above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been29

performed;30

(6)  Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay31

the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in children who experience distress at32

identifying with their biological sex.  This is being done despite the lack of any long-term33

longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment34

of such distress or gender transition;35

(7)  Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who36

experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no37

randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of38

cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender39

transition;40

(8)  The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks:41



23 LC 33 9320

S. B. 141
- 3 -

(A)  For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery42

disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine43

cancers, and irreversible infertility; and44

(B)  For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery45

disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer,46

and irreversible infertility;47

(9)  Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for48

children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are49

becoming more frequent;50

(10)  Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures51

for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and52

functional body parts:53

(A)  For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including54

penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty; and55

(B)  For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy,56

reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or57

phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular58

prostheses;59

(11)  The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender60

reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex;61

(12)  Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for62

males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and63

functional body parts:64

(A)  For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial65

feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction,66

gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures; and67



23 LC 33 9320

S. B. 141
- 4 -

(B)  For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice68

surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures;69

(13)  It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or70

product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases.  Just71

between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by 20 percent;72

(14)  It is of grave concern that the medical community is allowing individuals who73

experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and74

drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing75

genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits76

of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and77

(15)  The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of78

clinical study on these procedures.79

SECTION 2.80

Chapter 1 of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general81

provisions relative to professions and businesses, is amending by adding a new Code section82

to read as follows:83

"43-1-36.84

(a)  As used in this Code section, the term:85

(1) 'Health care provider' means any person licensed under Chapter 9, 10A, 11, 11A, 26,86

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

Sec. 5.  (1) No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against5

in any manner because the medical practitioner:6

violation of, any provision of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act;15

(b) Testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning such16

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

(2) Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no20

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner because21

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of27

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or28

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

a medical practitioner with any complaints it has received which may12

result in the revocation of the medical practitioner's license,13

certification, or registration within fourteen days after receipt of the14

complaint.15

(b) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or16

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must pay the17

medical practitioner an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars18

for each day the complaint is not provided to the medical practitioner19

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

Session of 2023

SENATE BILL No. 180

By Committee on Public Health and Welfare

2-7

AN ACT establishing the women's bill of rights; providing a meaning of 
biological sex for purposes of statutory construction.

WHEREAS,  Male  and  female  individuals  possess  unique  and 
immutable biological differences that manifest prior to birth and increase 
as such individuals age and experience puberty; and

WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes mean that only 
female individuals are able to become pregnant, give birth and breastfeed 
children; and

WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes mean that male 
individuals  are,  on  average,  bigger,  stronger  and  faster  than  female 
individuals; and

WHEREAS,  Biological  differences  between  the  sexes  leave  female 
individuals more physically vulnerable than male individuals to specific 
forms of violence, including sexual violence; and

WHEREAS,  Female  individuals  have  historically  suffered  from 
discrimination in education, athletics and employment; and

WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes are enduring and 
may,  in  some  circumstances,  warrant  the  creation  of  separate  social, 
educational, athletics or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to allow 
members of each sex to succeed and thrive; and

WHEREAS, Inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with 
respect to the definitions of "sex," "male," "female," "man" and "woman" 
have led to the endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources thereby 
necessitating the clarification of certain terms.

Now, therefore:
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:

Section  1. (a)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  state  law  to  the 
contrary, with respect to the application of an individual's biological sex 
pursuant  to  any state  law or  rules  and  regulations,  the  following shall 
apply:

(1) An  individual's  "sex"  means  such  individual's  biological  sex, 
either male or female, at birth;

(2) a "female" is an individual whose biological reproductive system 
is  developed  to  produce  ova,  and  a  "male"  is  an  individual  whose 
biological  reproductive  system  is  developed  to  fertilize  the  ova  of  a

female;
(3) the terms "woman" and "girl"  refer to human females,  and the 

terms "man" and "boy" refer to human males;
(4) the term "mother" means a parent of the female sex, and the term 

"father" means a parent of the male sex;
(5) with respect  to biological  sex,  the term "equal" does not  mean 

"same" or "identical"; and
(6) with respect to biological sex, separate accommodations are not 

inherently unequal.
(b) Laws and rules and regulations that distinguish between the sexes 

are  subject  to  intermediate  constitutional  scrutiny.  Intermediate 
constitutional  scrutiny  forbids  unfair  discrimination  against  similarly 
situated  male  and  female  individuals  but  allows  the  law to  distinguish 
between  the  sexes  where  such  distinctions  are  substantially  related  to 
important governmental objectives. Notwithstanding any provision of state 
law to the contrary, distinctions between the sexes with respect to athletics, 
prisons or other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape crisis 
centers, locker rooms, restrooms and other areas where biology, safety or 
privacy  are  implicated  that  result  in  separate  accommodations  are 
substantially  related  to  the  important  governmental  objectives  of 
protecting  the  health,  safety  and  privacy  of  individuals  in  such 
circumstances.

(c) Any school district, or public school thereof, and any state agency, 
department or office or political subdivision that collects vital statistics for 
the purpose of complying with anti-discrimination laws or for the purpose 
of gathering accurate public health, crime, economic or other data shall 
identify each individual who is part of the collected data set as either male 
or female at birth.

Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its 
publication in the statute book.

verification under subsection (a)(2) before the 31st day after receiving the 
request  from the treasurer is  presumed to be engaged in an ideological

issue policy statements on behalf of such financial company; and

(3) information published by a state or federal governmental entity.
(d) In  determining whether  to  include  a  financial  company on the

(1) Statements or complaints by a boycotted company; or
(2) media reports of a financial company's ideological boycott.

(3) such restricted financial list is published on the treasurer's website 

and sent to the board, the president of the senate, the speaker of the house 
of representatives and the attorney general.

(g) Following  a  restricted  financial  company's  inclusion  on  the 
restricted financial company list, the treasurer shall remove such financial 
company from such list if the financial company demonstrates that such 
financial company has ceased all ideological boycotts.

(h) The treasurer shall update the list annually or more often as the 
treasurer considers necessary, but not more often than quarterly, based on 
information from sources listed in subsection (a), among other sources.

or updated, the treasurer shall file the list with the president of the senate, 
the speaker of the house of representatives and the attorney general and 
post the list on the treasurer's website in a location that is easily accessible 
to the public. The treasurer shall include at the top of such list a citation to

inclusion on the list is not an indication of unsafe or unsound operating 
conditions of any financial institution or any risk of consumer deposits.

New  Sec.  8. Not  later  than  the  30th day  after  the  date  the  board 
receives the list provided under section 7,  and amendments thereto, the 
board shall notify the treasurer of the listed financial companies in which

(3) offering  the  financial  company  the  opportunity  to  clarify  its 
activities  related  to  companies  prescribed  by  section  1(b)(4),  and 
amendments thereto.

(b) Not later than the 90th day after the date the financial company 
receives  notice  under  subsection (a),  the financial  company shall  cease 
engaging in ideological boycotts in order to avoid divestment by the board.

(c) If,  during  the  time  provided  by  subsection  (b),  the  financial 
company  ceases  engaging  in  ideological  boycotts,  the  treasurer  shall 
remove the financial company from the list maintained under section 7, 
and amendments thereto. In which case, the provisions of this act shall no 
longer  apply to  such  financial  company unless  such financial  company 
resumes engaging in ideological boycotts.

HB 2404 9

(d) If, after the time provided by subsection (b) expires, the financial 
company continues to engage in ideological boycotts, the board shall sell, 
redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the financial 
company,  except  securities  described  by  section  11,  and  amendments 
thereto,  according  to  the  schedule  provided  by  section  10,  and 
amendments thereto.

New Sec. 10. (a) When the board is required to sell, redeem, divest or 
withdraw all publicly traded securities of a listed financial company, the 
board shall comply with the following schedule:

(1) At least 50% of those assets shall be removed from the system's 
assets under management not later than the 180th day after the date the 
financial  company  receives  notice  under  section  9,  and  amendments 
thereto, or subsection (b) unless the board determines that a later date is 
more  prudent,  based  on  a  good  faith  exercise  of  the  board's  fiduciary 
discretion and subject to paragraph (2); and

(2) 100% of such assets shall be removed from the system's assets 
under management not later than the 360th day after the date the financial 
company receives  notice  under  section  9,  and  amendments  thereto,  or 
subsection (b).

(b) If  a  financial  company  that  ceased  engaging  in  ideological 
boycotts after receiving notice under section 9, and amendments thereto, 
resumes such financial company's boycott, the board shall send a written 
notice to the financial company informing such financial company that the 
board will sell, redeem, divest or withdraw all publicly traded securities of 
the financial company according to the schedule in subsection (a).

(c) Except as provided by subsection (a),  the board may delay the 
schedule for divestment under such subsection only to the extent that the 
board determines, in the board's good faith judgment and consistent with 
the board's fiduciary duty, that divestment from listed financial companies 
will likely result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation as provided 
by section 12(b), and amendments thereto. If the board delays the schedule 
for  divestment,  the  board  shall  submit  a  report  to  the  treasurer,  the 
president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the 
attorney general stating the reasons and justification for the board's delay 
in divestment from listed financial  companies.  The report  shall  include 
documentation supporting the board's  determination that  the divestment 
would result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation as provided by 
section  12(b),  and  amendments  thereto,  including  objective  numerical 
estimates. The board shall update the report every six months.

New Sec. 11. The board is also required to divest from any indirect 
holdings  in  actively or  passively managed  investment  funds  or  private 
equity funds containing listed financial companies. The board shall submit 
letters to the managers of each investment fund containing listed financial

companies requesting that they remove such financial companies from the 
fund or create a similar actively or passively managed fund with indirect 
holdings  devoid  of  listed  financial  companies.  If  a  manager  creates  a 
similar  fund  with  substantially  the  same  management  fees  and 
substantially the same level of investment risk and anticipated return, the 
board  may  replace  all  applicable  investments  with  investments  in  the 
similar fund in a time frame consistent with prudent fiduciary standards 
but  not  later  than the 450th day after  the date the fund is  created.  If  a 
manager does not  create  such similar  fund, the board shall  divest  from 
such indirect holdings in actively or passively managed investment funds 
or private equity funds.

New Sec. 12. (a) Except as provided by this section, the system may 
not acquire securities of a listed financial company.

(b) The board may cease divesting from one or more listed financial 
companies only if clear and convincing evidence shows that:

(1) The system has suffered or will suffer a greater than 25% loss in 
the hypothetical value of all assets under management by the system as a 
result of having to divest from listed financial companies under this act; or

(2) an  individual  portfolio  that  uses  a  benchmark-aware  strategy 
would be subject to an aggregate expected deviation from its benchmark of 
greater  than  25% as  a  result  of  having  to  divest  from listed  financial 
companies under this act.

(c) The board may cease divesting from a listed financial company as 
provided by this section only to the extent necessary to ensure that  the 
system does not suffer a loss in value or deviate from its benchmark as 
described by subsection (b).

(d) Before  the  board  may  cease  divesting  from  a  listed  financial 
company under this section, the board shall provide a written report to the 
treasurer,  the  president  of  the  senate,  the  speaker  of  the  house  of 
representatives  and  the  attorney  general  stating  the  reason  and 
justification, supported by clear and convincing evidence, for deciding to 
cease divestment or to remain invested in a listed financial company.

(e) The  board  shall  update  the  report  required  by  subsection  (d) 
semiannually, as applicable.

(f) This section does not apply to reinvestment in a financial company 
that is no longer a listed financial company.

New Sec. 13. Not later than the first day of the regular session of the 
legislature, each year, the board shall file a report with the treasurer, the 
president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the 
attorney general that:

(a) Identifies all securities sold, redeemed, divested or withdrawn in 
compliance with section 10, and amendments thereto;

(b) identifies  all  prohibited  investments  under  section  12,  and

and  to  investigate  potential  violations  of  sections  1  through  14,  and 
amendments thereto.

New  Sec.  15. (a)  On  or  before  July  1,  2024,  the  treasurer  shall 
prepare  and  maintain  a  list  of  financial  institutions  that  are  engaged

institutions list, on the treasurer's website and submit a copy of such list to 
the  governor,  the  attorney general,  the  president  of  the  senate  and  the 
speaker of the house of representatives.

(c) The treasurer shall include a citation to this section and a brief 
summary of  the purpose of  the  list  at  the top of  such  list,  including a 
statement  that  inclusion  on  the  list  is  not  an  indication  of  unsafe  or 
unsound operating conditions of any financial  institution or any risk of 
consumer deposits.

(d) The treasurer shall update the restricted financial institution list 
annually and may update such list more frequently as the treasurer deems 
necessary. 

New  Sec.  16. (a)  The  treasurer  shall  send  a  written  notice  to  a 
financial institution 45 days prior to including such financial institution on 
the restricted financial  institution list.  Such written notice shall  provide 
that:

(1) The  treasurer  has  determined  that  the  financial  institution  is  a 
restricted financial institution;

(2) the financial institution will be placed on the restricted financial 
institution list in 45 days unless, within 30 days following receipt of the 
written notice,  the restricted financial  institution demonstrates  that  such 
financial institution is not engaged in ideological boycotts;

(3) such  restricted  financial  institution  list  is  published  on  the 
treasurer's website; and

(4) the financial institution's placement on the list may render such 
financial institution ineligible to enter into or renew any banking contracts 
with the state of Kansas. 

(b) Following  a  restricted  financial  institution's  inclusion  on  the 
restricted financial institution list, the treasurer shall remove such financial 
institution from such list if the financial institution demonstrates that such 
financial institution has ceased engaging in ideological boycotts.

nondiscriminatory basis;

New  Sec.  27. The  state  bank  commissioner,  the  commissioner  of 
insurance  and  the  credit  union  administrator  shall  adopt  rules  and 
regulations  for  the  enforcement  of  sections  24  through  27,  and 
amendments thereto.  Such rules  and regulations shall  be adopted on or 
before July 1, 2024.

New Sec.  28. (a)  A registered  investment  adviser  shall  disclose  to 
such registered investment adviser's clients, prior to the investment of any 
moneys owned by the client in or through any mutual fund, actively or 
passively managed equity fund,  company or  financial  institution that  is 
engaged in ideological boycotts, is a listed financial company or is on the 
restricted financial institutions list prepared, maintained and published by 
the treasurer pursuant to section 15, and amendments thereto, that such

financial  institution  is  engaged  in  ideological  boycotts  and  that  such 
ideological boycotts may limit the client's return on investment.

(b) Prior to the investment of a client's funds, a registered investment

"The institution managing this fund is engaged in ideological boycotts. 
If  such  boycotts  are  used  in  managing  your  fund,  these  boycotts  may 
reduce the fund's returns compared to the fund's historical performance or 
the performance of funds that do not use ideological boycotts. You may 
have  the  option  to  chose  a  similar  fund  that  does  not  use  ideological 
boycotts. By signing below, you consent to have your investment managed 
by this institution even if  the institution engages in ideological  boycott 
investment practices that may reduce your returns compared to historical 
performance or other funds."

requirements  for  registration,  capital,  custody,  margin,  financial

general may investigate possible violations of this section in accordance

New Sec. 29. The provisions of this act are severable. If any portion 
of the act is declared unconstitutional or invalid, or the application of any 
portion of the act to any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional or 
invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other portions of the act that can be 
given  effect  without  the  invalid  portion  or  application,  and  the 
applicability  of  such  other  portions  of  the  act  to  any  person  or 
circumstance shall remain valid and enforceable.

(4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement 
to commit,  or  by any concerted action committing,  any act  of  boycott,

amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract 
of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in 
any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner 
whatever.

(c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the  amount,  extent  or  kind  of  coverage  available  to  an  individual,  or 
charging  an  individual  a  different  rate  for  the  same  coverage  solely 
because  of  blindness  or  partial  blindness.  With  respect  to  all  other 
conditions,  including  the  underlying  cause  of  the  blindness  or  partial 
blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the 
same  standards  of  sound  actuarial  principles  or  actual  or  reasonably 
anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes 
denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that 
the policy defines  "disability"  as  being presumed in  the  event  that  the 
insured loses  such  person's  eyesight.  However,  an insurer  may exclude 
from  coverage  disabilities  consisting  solely  of  blindness  or  partial 
blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

(d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health 
and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a 
different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for 
losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based 
on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or 
may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
(d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined 
in  K.S.A.  60-3102,  and amendments  thereto,  between  family members, 
current  or  former  household  members,  or  current  or  former  intimate 
partners.

(i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health 
insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may 
be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek 
medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse, 
protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.

(ii) Nothing in  this  section shall  be construed to prohibit  a person 
from  declining  to  issue  an  insurance  policy  insuring  the  life  of  an 
individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if 
the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the 
insurance policy.

(iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an 
individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall 
be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered 
by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.

(iv) No person  shall  refuse  to  insure,  refuse to  continue  to  insure,

limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or 
charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or 
mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is 
based on sound actuarial principles.

(v) Nothing in  this  section shall  be construed to  prohibit  a  person 
from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or 
mental  condition,  even  if  such  condition  has  been  caused  by  abuse, 
provided that:

(A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the 
same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim 
of abuse;

(B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of 
abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and

(C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this 
section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.

(vi) Any  person  who  underwrites  or  rates  a  risk  on  the  basis  of 
preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
(v),  shall  treat  such  underwriting  or  rating  as  an  adverse  underwriting 
decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.

(vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life 
and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective 
date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the 
effective date of this act.

(e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting 
the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an 
individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage, 
solely because of such individual's  status as a living organ donor.  With 
respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall 
be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or 
reasonably  anticipated  experience  as  are  persons  who  are  not  organ 
donors.

(8) Rebates. (a)  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  by  law, 
knowingly permitting,  offering to  make or  making any contract  of  life 
insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to 
such  contract  other  than  as  plainly expressed  in  the  insurance  contract 
issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give, 
directly or  indirectly,  as  inducement  to  such insurance,  or  annuity,  any 
rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage 
in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or 
inducement  whatever  not  specified  in  the  contract;  or  giving,  selling, 
purchasing or  offering to  give,  sell  or  purchase as  inducement  to  such 
insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds 
or  other  securities  of  any  insurance  company  or  other  corporation,

association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or 
anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.

(b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including 
within  the  definition  of  discrimination  or  rebates  any of  the  following 
practices:

(i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying 
bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or 
in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any 
such  bonuses  or  abatement  of  premiums shall  be  fair  and  equitable  to 
policyholders  and  for  the  best  interests  of  the  company  and  its 
policyholders;

(ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit 
plan,  making  allowance  to  policyholders  who  have  continuously  for  a 
specified  period  made  premium  payments  directly  to  an  office  of  the 
insurer  in  an  amount  that  fairly  represents  the  saving  in  collection 
expenses; or

(iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy 
based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first 
or  any  subsequent  policy  year  of  insurance  thereunder,  which  may be 
made retroactive only for such policy year.

(9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement 
practice if  any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining 
thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such 
provisions,  or  committed  with  such  frequency  as  to  indicate  a  general 
business practice:

(a) Misrepresenting  pertinent  facts  or  insurance  policy  provisions 
relating to coverages at issue;

(b) failing  to  acknowledge  and  act  reasonably  promptly  upon 
communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;

(c) failing  to  adopt  and  implement  reasonable  standards  for  the 
prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies;

(d) refusing  to  pay  claims  without  conducting  a  reasonable 
investigation based upon all available information;

(e) failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable 
time after proof of loss statements have been completed;

(f) not  attempting  in  good  faith  to  effectuate  prompt,  fair  and 
equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably 
clear;

(g) compelling insureds to institute litigation to recover amounts due 
under an insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amounts 
ultimately recovered in actions brought by such insureds;

(h) attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a 
reasonable person would have believed that such person was entitled by

reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made 
part of an application;

(i) attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was 
altered without notice to, or knowledge or consent of the insured;

(j) making  claims  payments  to  insureds  or  beneficiaries  not 
accompanied  by  a  statement  setting  forth  the  coverage  under  which

obtained  as  a  consequence  of  that  interest  from  the  referral  of  title 
business.

(iii) "Person"  means  any  natural  person,  partnership,  association, 
cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.

insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has 
reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of 
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the

will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and 
(ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent 
during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in 
which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The 
prohibitions  contained  in  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply to  transactions 
involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by 
the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.

(h) Within  90  days  following  the  end  of  each  business  year,  as

shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which 
the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by 
the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under 
penalty of  perjury,  stating the  percent  of  closed title  orders  originating 
from controlled business.  The failure of  a title  insurer  or title  agent to 
comply  with  the  requirements  of  this  section,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
commissioner,  shall  be  grounds  for  the  suspension  or  revocation  of  a 
license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate 
any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be 
in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal 
housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.

(i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance 
order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if  it  knows or has 
reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of 
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the 
associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent 
to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing 
to the person so referred the fact that  such producer or associate has a 
financial  interest  in  the  title  insurer  or  title  agent,  the  nature  of  the 
financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges 
generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services.  Such 
disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated 
to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate 
has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers 
of  not  less  than  three  other  title  insurers  or  agents  that  operate  in  the 
county in which the property is located.  If  fewer than three insurers or 
agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers 
or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed 
by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment 
having been made to such title insurer or agent.

(2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall 
require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any 
other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract, 
lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any

kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial 
interest in such title agent or title insurer.

(3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order 
or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to 
believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales 
contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.

(4) Nothing  in  this  paragraph  shall  prohibit  any  producer  of  title 
business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any 
title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if 
such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in 
the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or 
realized from such financial interest, so long as:

(a) Such financial  interest  is  disclosed to the purchaser  of the title 
insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);

(b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for 
the referral of business; and

(c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return 
on the investment of the producer or associate.

(5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who 
violates  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  (i)(2)  through  (i)(4),  or  any  title 
insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that 
it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other 
action  that  may  be  taken  by  the  commissioner  of  insurance,  shall  be 
subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the 
premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034 
et seq.,  and amendments thereto, shall  be deemed to have committed a 
prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and 
shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal 
to the premium for the title insurance.

(6) Any title insurer or title agent that  is  a  competitor of any title 
insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has 
violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause 
of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the 
existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition 
to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or 
injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this 
subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of 
the action together with reasonable attorney fees.

(7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide 
core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.

(j) The commissioner shall adopt any regulations necessary to carry 
out the provisions of this act.

(15) Disclosure  of  nonpublic  personal  information. (a)  No  person

shall  disclose  any  nonpublic  personal  information  contrary  to  the 
provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law 
106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to 
carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent 
with  and  not  more  restrictive  than  the  model  regulation  adopted  on 
September  26,  2000,  by  the  national  association  of  insurance 
commissioners  entitled  "Privacy  of  consumer  financial  and  health 
information regulation".

(b) Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  be  deemed  or  construed  to 
authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts, 
supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning 
requirements  for  notification  of,  or  obtaining  consent  from,  a  parent, 
guardian  or  other  legal  custodian  of  a  minor  relating  to  any  matter 
pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.

Sec. 31. K.S.A. 75-4208 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-
4208. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b),  the board shall follow the 
procedure prescribed in rules and regulations adopted under the provisions 
of  K.S.A.  75-4232,  and  amendments  thereto,  in  designating  banks  to 
receive  deposit  of  state  moneys  in  operating  accounts  and  investment 
accounts.  The  board  shall  determine  which  banks  shall  receive  state 
operating  and  investment  accounts  and  shall  designate  the  types  of 
accounts to be awarded each such bank and the initial  amount of each 
award. Such initial awards which are operating accounts shall be made as 
provided in K.S.A. 75-4205, and amendments thereto. Such initial awards 
which are investment accounts shall be awarded as is provided in K.S.A. 
75-4209, and amendments thereto. Upon making the awards provided for 
above, the board shall notify each bank of its award, and that the same is 
subject to approval of securities to be pledged as prescribed in this act.

(b) The board shall not designate a bank to receive deposit of state  
moneys in operating  accounts or investment accounts if  such bank has  
been listed by the state treasurer as a restricted  financial institution as  
provided in section 15, and amendments thereto. Any agreement awarding 
the deposit of state moneys in operating accounts or investment accounts  
for a term commencing on or after July 1, 2024, shall comply with the  
provisions of section 18, and amendments thereto.

Sec. 32. K.S.A. 75-4208 and K.S.A. 2022 Supp. 40-2404 are hereby

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2 

16-112-4. Cause of action. 3

relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher 6

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

and Diversity Act; and to provide severability.2

Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska,3

Section 1.  Sections 1 to 6 of this act shall be known and may be1

cited as the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act.2

Sec. 2.  (1) The Legislature finds and declares that:3

(a) The right of conscience is a fundamental and unalienable right.4

It was central to the founding of the United States, has been deeply5

rooted in our nation's history and tradition for centuries, and has been6

central to the practice of medicine, through the Hippocratic Oath, for7

millennia;8

(b) Despite its preeminent importance, however, threats to the right9

of conscience of medical practitioners, health care institutions, and10

health care payers have become increasingly more common and severe in11

recent years. The swift pace of scientific advancement and the expansion12

of medical capabilities, along with the mistaken notion that medical13

practitioners, health care institutions, and health care payers are mere14

public utilities, promise only to make the current crisis worse, unless15

something is done to restore conscience to its rightful place;16

(c) It is the public policy of the State of Nebraska to protect the17

right of conscience for medical practitioners, health care institutions,18

and health care payers; and19

(d) As the right of conscience is fundamental, no medical20

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer should be21

compelled to participate in or pay for any medical procedure or prescribe22

or pay for any medication to which such person or entity objects on the23

basis of conscience, whether such conscience is informed by religious,24

moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.25

(2) It is the purpose of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act to26

protect medical practitioners, health care institutions, and health care27

payers from discrimination, punishment, or retaliation as a result of any28

instance of conscientious medical objection.29

Sec. 3.  For purposes of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act:30

(1) Conscience means the ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-2-



principles held by any medical practitioner, health care institution, or1

health care payer. Conscience with respect to institutional entities or2

corporate bodies, as opposed to individual persons, is determined by3

reference to that entity's or body's governing documents, including, but4

not limited to, any published religious, moral, or ethical guidelines or5

directives, mission statements, constitutions, articles of incorporation,6

bylaws, policies, or regulations;7

(2) Disclose means to formally or informally communicate or transmit8

information, but such term does not include a communication or9

transmission concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise10

discretionary authority unless the medical practitioner providing the11

disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evinces:12

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;13

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any14

health care service; or15

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of16

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or17

safety;18

(3) Discriminate means to take adverse action against, or to19

threaten the use of adverse action against, any medical practitioner,20

health care institution, or health care payer as a result of such21

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in a health care22

service on the basis of conscience. The term includes, but is not limited23

to, termination of employment; transfer from current position; demotion24

from current position; adverse administrative action; reassignment to a25

different shift or job title; increased administrative duties; refusal of26

staff privileges; refusal of board certification and recertification;27

loss of career specialty; reduction of wages, benefits, or privileges;28

refusal to award a grant, contract, or other program; refusal to provide29

residency training opportunities; denial, deprivation, or30

disqualification of licensure; withholding or disqualifying from31

financial aid and other assistance; impediments to creating any health1

care institution or health care payer or expanding or improving such2

health care institution or health care payer; impediments to acquiring,3

associating with, or merging with any other health care institution or4

health care payer; the threat of any of the actions listed in this5

subdivision; or any other penalty, disciplinary action, or retaliatory6

action, whether executed or threatened. The term does not include the7

negotiation or purchase of insurance by a nongovernmental entity;8

(4) Health care institution means any organization, corporation,9

partnership, association, agency, network, sole proprietorship, joint10

venture, or any other entity that provides health care services. Health11

care institutions may include, but are not limited to, any public or12

private hospital, clinic, medical center, physician organization,13

professional association or corporation, ambulatory surgical center,14

private physician's office, pharmacy, nursing home, medical school,15

nursing school, medical training facility, or other entity or location in16

which health care services are performed;17

(5) Health care payer means any employer, health plan, health18

maintenance organization, insurance company, management services19

organization, or other entity that pays for, or arranges for the payment20

of, any health care service provided to any patient, whether that payment21

is made in whole or in part;22

(6) Health care service means medical research or medical care23

provided to any patient at any time over the entire course of treatment.24

The term includes, but is not limited to, testing; diagnosis; referral;25

dispensing or administering any drug, medication, or device;26

psychological therapy or counseling; research; prognosis; therapy; record27

making procedures; notes related to treatment; set up or performance of a28

surgery or procedure; or any other care or services performed or provided29

by any medical practitioner including, but not limited to, physicians,30

nurses, allied health professionals, paraprofessionals, or contractors or31

2023

LB810
2023

employees of health care institutions;1

(7) Medical practitioner means any person or individual who may be2

or is asked to participate in any way in any health care service. The3

term includes, but is not limited to, doctors, nurse practitioners,4

physician's assistants, nurses, nurses' aides, allied health5

professionals, medical assistants, hospital employees, clinic employees,6

nursing home employees, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and employees,7

medical school faculty and students, nursing school faculty and students,8

psychology and counseling faculty and students, medical researchers,9

laboratory technicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, mental10

health professionals, social workers, or any other person who facilitates11

or participates in the provision of health care services to any person;12

(8) Participate in a health care service means to provide, perform,13

assist with, facilitate, direct, refer for, counsel for, advise with14

regard to, admit for the purposes of providing, or take part in any way15

in providing, any health care service or any form of such service; and16

(9) Pay or payment means to pay for, contract for, arrange for the17

payment of, whether in whole or in part, reimburse, or remunerate.18

Sec. 4.  (1) A medical practitioner, health care institution, or19

health care payer has the right not to participate in or pay for any20

health care service which violates such person's or entity's conscience.21

The exercise of the right of conscience is limited to conscience-based22

objections to a particular health care service. This section shall not be23

construed to waive or modify any duty a medical practitioner, health care24

institution, or health care payer may have to provide other medical25

services that do not violate such person's or entity's conscience.26

(2) When a medical practitioner becomes aware of a potential27

conflict of conscience, the medical practitioner shall notify the28

practitioner's supervisor, if applicable, and shall be excused from29

participating in the health care service that conflicts with the30

practitioner's religious, moral, or ethical beliefs and convictions. Upon31

LB810
2023

LB810
2023

-5-



patient request, the medical practitioner shall assist in the transfer of1

the patient's care with regard to a particular health care service by2

promptly releasing the patient's medical records to the patient. The3

medical practitioner remains responsible for continuing to provide all4

appropriate health care services, other than the health care service that5

conflicts with the medical practitioner's beliefs or convictions.6

(3) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care7

payer shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for8

exercising such person's or entity's right of conscience not to9

participate in or pay for a health care service. No health care10

institution shall be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for11

the exercise of conscience rights not to participate in a health care12

service by a medical practitioner employed, contracted, or granted13

admitting privileges by the health care institution.14

(4) No medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care15

payer shall be discriminated against in any manner as a result of such16

person's or entity's decision to decline to participate in or pay for a17

health care service on the basis of conscience.18

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Medical Ethics and19

Diversity Act to the contrary, a religious medical practitioner, health20

care institution, or health care payer that holds itself out to the21

public as religious, states in its governing documents that it has a22

religious purpose or mission, and has internal operating policies or23

procedures that implement its religious beliefs, shall have the right to24

make employment, staffing, contracting, and admitting privilege decisions25

consistent with its religious beliefs.26

(6) A medical practitioner may not be scheduled for or assigned to27

directly or indirectly perform, facilitate, or participate in an28

abortion, as defined in section 71-6901 unless the practitioner first29

affirmatively consents in writing to perform, facilitate, or participate30

in the abortion.31

(7) Nothing in the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act shall be1

construed to override the requirement to provide emergency medical2

treatment to all patients set forth in 42 U.S.C. 1395dd or any other3

federal law governing emergency medical treatments.4

Sec. 5.  (1) No medical practitioner shall be discriminated against5

in any manner because the medical practitioner:6

(a) Provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause7

to be provided to such practitioner's employer, the Attorney General, the8

Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, any other state agency9

charged with protecting health care rights of conscience, the Office for10

Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human11

Services, or any other federal agency charged with protecting health care12

rights of conscience information relating to any violation of, or any act13

or omission the medical practitioner reasonably believes to be a14

violation of, any provision of the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act;15

(b) Testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning such16

violation; or17

(c) Assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate,18

in such a proceeding.19

(2) Unless the disclosure is specifically prohibited by law, no20

medical practitioner shall be discriminated against in any manner because21

the medical practitioner disclosed any information that the medical22

practitioner reasonably believes evinces:23

(a) Any violation of any law, rule, or regulation;24

(b) Any violation of any ethical guidelines for the provision of any25

health care service; or26

(c) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of27

authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or28

safety.29

(3) A licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or the30

Department of Health and Human Services, may not reprimand, sanction, or31

revoke or threaten to revoke a license, certification, or registration of1

a health care practitioner for engaging in speech or expressive activity2

that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment,3

unless the board, entity, or the Department of Health and Human Services,4

as applicable, demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the5

practitioner's speech was the direct cause of physical harm to a person6

with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient7

relationship within the three years immediately preceding the incident of8

physical harm.9

(a) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or10

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must provide11

a medical practitioner with any complaints it has received which may12

result in the revocation of the medical practitioner's license,13

certification, or registration within fourteen days after receipt of the14

complaint.15

(b) The licensing, certifying, or recognizing board or entity, or16

the Department of Health and Human Services, as applicable, must pay the17

medical practitioner an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars18

for each day the complaint is not provided to the medical practitioner19

after the specified fourteen days.20

Sec. 6.  (1) A civil action for damages or injunctive relief, or21

both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, health care22

institution, or health care payer for any violation of the Medical Ethics23

and Diversity Act. Any additional burden or expense on another medical24

practitioner, health care institution, or health care payer arising from25

the exercise of the right of conscience shall not be a defense to any26

violation of the act. However, no civil action may be brought against an27

individual who declines to use or purchase health care services from a28

specific medical practitioner, health care institution, or health care29

payer for exercising the rights granted in subsection (1) of section 4 of30

this act.31

(2) Any party aggrieved by any violation of the act may commence a1

civil action and shall be entitled, upon the finding of a violation, to2

recover the party's actual damages sustained, but in no case shall3

recovery be less than five thousand dollars, along with the costs of the4

action and reasonable attorney's fees. Such damages shall be cumulative5

and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under6

any other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such7

civil action may also award injunctive relief, which may include, but is8

not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner to the9

practitioner's previous position, reinstatement of board certification,10

and relicensure of a health care institution or health care payer.11

Sec. 7.  If any section in this act or any part of any section is12

declared invalid or unconstitutional, the declaration shall not affect13

the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions.14

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, 1 

intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex. 2

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

SECTION 1. That Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended11
by the addition thereto of a NEW CHAPTER, to be known and designated as Chap-12
ter 66, Title 33, Idaho Code, and to read as follows:13

CHAPTER 6614
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS15

33-6601. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. The legislature finds that:16
(1) There are real and inherent physical differences between men and17

women;18
(2) Every person has a natural right to privacy and safety in restrooms19

and changing facilities where such person might be in a partial or full state20
of undress in the presence of others;21

(3) This natural right especially applies to students using public22
school restrooms and changing facilities where student privacy and safety is23
essential to providing a safe learning environment for all students;24

(4) Requiring students to share restrooms and changing facilities with25
members of the opposite biological sex generates potential embarrassment,26
shame, and psychological injury to students, as well as increasing the like-27
lihood of sexual assault, molestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism;28

(5) Providing separate public school restrooms and changing facilities29
for the different biological sexes is a long-standing and widespread prac-30
tice protected by federal law, state law, and case law;31

(6) Federal legislative action, federal executive action, and fed-32
eral court judgments that prevent public schools from maintaining separate33
restrooms and changing facilities for different biological sexes are in-34
consistent with the United States constitution and violate the privacy and35
safety rights of students; and36

(7) A statewide policy ensuring separate school restrooms and chang-37
ing facilities on the basis of biological sex is substantially related to the38
important governmental interest in protecting the privacy and safety of all39
students.40



2

House Concurrent Resolution No. 3010 - Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly of North Dakota - LC Number 23.3027.02000


23.3027.02000

Sixty-eighth
Legislative Assembly
of North Dakota

Introduced by

Representatives S. Olson, K. Anderson, Henderson, Meier, Novak, Rohr, Steiner, VanWinkle

A concurrent resolution urging public schools and public entities, including agencies or 

departments that collect vital statistics, to protect women's rights by distinguishing between the 

sexes according to biological sex at birth for the purpose of providing equal opportunities and 

ensuring the privacy and safety of women and girls.

WHEREAS, a male and a female possess unique and immutable biological differences that 

manifest prior to birth and increase as the individual ages and experiences puberty; and

WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes mean that only a female is able to 

become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed children; and

WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes mean that a male is, on average, 

bigger, stronger, and faster than a female; and

WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes leave a female more physically 

vulnerable than a male to specific forms of violence, including sexual violence; and

WHEREAS, females have suffered historically from discrimination in education, athletics, 

and employment; and

WHEREAS, when it comes to sex, "equal" does not mean "same" or "identical" and 

separate is not inherently unequal; and

WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes are enduring and may warrant the 

creation of separate social, educational, athletic, or other spaces to ensure safety or allow 

members of each sex to succeed and thrive; and

WHEREAS, inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with respect to the 

definitions of "sex", "male", "female", "man", and "woman" have led to endangerment of 

single-sex spaces and resources, thereby necessitating clarification of certain terms; and

WHEREAS, there are legitimate reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to 

athletics, prisons and other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape and abuse

crisis centers, locker rooms, restrooms, and other areas where safety and privacy are 

implicated; and

WHEREAS, policies and laws that distinguish between the sexes are subject to 

intermediate constitutional scrutiny, which forbids unfair discrimination against similarly situated 

males and females but allows the law to distinguish between the sexes if distinctions are 

substantially related to important governmental objectives;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF 

NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:

That the Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly urges public schools and public entities, 

including agencies or departments that collect vital statistics, to protect women's rights by 

distinguishing between the sexes according to biological sex at birth for the purpose of 

providing equal opportunities and ensuring the privacy and safety of women and girls; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward a copy of this resolution 

to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the superintendent of each school district in the 

state, and the Executive Director of the Department of Health and Human Services.

 13 

Section 2. Section 2-18-208, MCA, is amended to read: 14 

"2-18-208. Comparable worth. The department of administration shall, in its continuous efforts to 15

practices is adopted by Montana: 18 

"There are basic principles of decency, honesty, and fair play that every candidate for public office in 19 

the United States has a moral obligation to observe and uphold, in order that, after vigorously contested but 20 

fairly conducted campaigns, our citizens may exercise their constitutional right to a free and untrammeled 21 

choice and the will of the people may be fully and clearly expressed on the issues before the country. 22 

Therefore: 23 

I will conduct my campaign in the best American tradition, discussing the issues as I see them, 24 

presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record 25 

and policies of my opponent and my opponent's party that merit such criticism. 26 

I will defend and uphold the right of every qualified American voter to full and equal participation in the 27 

electoral process. 28 



 
****   
68th Legislature 2023   SB 458.1 

 

 - 4 -  Authorized Print Version – SB 458  
 
 

I will conduct my campaign without the use of personal vilification, character defamation, whispering 1 

campaigns, libel, slander, or scurrilous attacks on my opposition or my opposition's personal or family life. 2 

I will not use campaign material of any sort that misrepresents, distorts, or otherwise falsifies the facts, 3 

nor will I use malicious or unfounded accusations that aim at creating or exploiting doubts, without justification, 4 

as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition. 5 

I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201, creed, or national 6 

origin. 7 

I will not undertake or condone any dishonest or unethical practice that tends to corrupt or undermine 8 

our American system of free elections or that hampers or prevents the full and free expression of the will of the 9 

voters. 10 

Insofar as is possible, I will immediately and publicly repudiate support deriving from any individual or 11 

group that resorts, on behalf of my candidacy or in opposition to that of my opponent, to the methods and 12 

tactics that I have pledged not to use or condone."" 13 

 14

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2023 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are "inherent differences between men and women," and that these differences 2 

"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity," United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin," Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance," Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 2 of 5 

Shreve, "Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people," United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the "full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that "high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like "high school track"); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the "gender gap" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. "These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men." Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: "The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science," 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even "after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy," a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones "had an absolute advantage" over female athletes and 33 

"will still likely have performance benefits" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., "Muscle 34 



 

 
 

LC001518 - Page 3 of 5 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen," Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 112  11 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 12 

16-112-1. Short title.  13

collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or 19 

national junior college athletic association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one of the 20 

following based on biological sex: 21 

(1) Males, men, or boys; 22 

(2) Females, women, or girls; or 23
