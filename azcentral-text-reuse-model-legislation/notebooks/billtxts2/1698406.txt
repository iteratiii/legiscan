Session of 2023
SENATE BILL No. 180
By Committee on Public Health and Welfare
2-7
AN ACT establishing the women's bill of rights; providing a meaning of  
biological sex for purposes of statutory construction.
WHEREAS,  Male  and  female  individuals  possess  unique  and  
immutable biological differences that manifest prior to birth and increase  
as such individuals age and experience puberty; and
WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes mean that only  
female individuals are able to become pregnant, give birth and breastfeed  
children; and
WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes mean that male  
individuals  are,  on  average,  bigger,  stronger  and  faster  than  female  
individuals; and
WHEREAS,  Biological  differences  between  the  sexes  leave  female  
individuals more physically vulnerable than male individuals to specific  
forms of violence, including sexual violence; and
WHEREAS,  Female  individuals  have  historically  suffered  from  
discrimination in education, athletics and employment; and
WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes are enduring and  
may,  in  some  circumstances,  warrant  the  creation  of  separate  social,  
educational, athletics or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to allow  
members of each sex to succeed and thrive; and
WHEREAS, Inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with  
respect to the definitions of "sex," "male," "female," "man" and "woman"  
have led to the endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources thereby  
necessitating the clarification of certain terms.
Now, therefore:
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
Section  1. (a)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  state  law  to  the  
contrary, with respect to the application of an individual's biological sex  
pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations, the following shall  
apply:
(1) An  individual's  "sex"  means  such  individual's  biological  sex,  
either male or female, at birth;
(2) a "female" is an individual whose biological reproductive system  
is  developed  to  produce  ova,  and  a  "male"  is  an  individual  whose  
biological  reproductive  system  is  developed  to  fertilize  the  ova  of  a  1

female;
(3) the terms "woman" and "girl" refer to human females, and the  
terms "man" and "boy" refer to human males;
(4) the term "mother" means a parent of the female sex, and the term  
"father" means a parent of the male sex;
(5) with respect to biological sex, the term "equal" does not mean  
"same" or "identical"; and
(6) with respect to biological sex, separate accommodations are not  
inherently unequal.
(b) Laws and rules and regulations that distinguish between the sexes  
are  subject  to  intermediate  constitutional  scrutiny.  Intermediate  
constitutional  scrutiny  forbids  unfair  discrimination  against  similarly  
situated male and female individuals but allows the law to distinguish  
between  the  sexes  where  such  distinctions  are  substantially related  to  
important governmental objectives. Notwithstanding any provision of state  
law to the contrary, distinctions between the sexes with respect to athletics,  
prisons or other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape crisis  
centers, locker rooms, restrooms and other areas where biology, safety or  
privacy  are  implicated  that  result  in  separate  accommodations  are  
substantially  related  to  the  important  governmental  objectives  of  
protecting  the  health,  safety  and  privacy  of  individuals  in  such  
circumstances.
(c) Any school district, or public school thereof, and any state agency,  
department or office or political subdivision that collects vital statistics for  
the purpose of complying with anti-discrimination laws or for the purpose  
of gathering accurate public health, crime, economic or other data shall  
identify each individual who is part of the collected data set as either male  
or female at birth.
Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its  
publication in the statute book.1
