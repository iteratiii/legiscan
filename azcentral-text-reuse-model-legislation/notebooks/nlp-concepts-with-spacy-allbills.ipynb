    "# Natural language processing concepts with spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "“Natural Language Processing” is a field at the intersection of computer science, linguistics and artificial intelligence which aims to make the underlying structure of language available to computer programs for analysis and manipulation. It’s a vast and vibrant field with a long history! New research and techniques are being developed constantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to introduce a few simple concepts and techniques from NLP—just the stuff that’ll help you do creative things quickly, and maybe open the door for you to understand more sophisticated NLP concepts that you might encounter elsewhere. We'll start with simple extraction tasks: isolating words, sentences, and parts of speech. By the end, we'll have a few working systems for creating sophisticated text generators that function by remixing texts based on their constituent linguistic units. This tutorial is written for Python 3.6+.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of libraries for performing natural language processing tasks in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/): a workhorse of a library, still widely used, but somewhat dated in terms of capabilities\n",
    "* [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/index.html) is a newish natural language processing library for Python, developed by the storied [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/). It includes a client library for Stanford NLP's [CoreNLP library](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) for functionality not yet natively available in Python.\n",
    "* [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/) is a library for developing and deploying natural language processing machine learning models, including models for [sentiment analysis](https://demo.allennlp.org/sentiment-analysis), [constituency parsing](https://demo.allennlp.org/constituency-parsing) and [co-reference resolution](https://demo.allennlp.org/coreference-resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we'll be using a library called [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), which very powerful and easy for newcomers to understand. It's been among the most important tools in my text processing toolbox for many years!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "“Natural language” is a loaded phrase: what makes one stretch of language “natural” while another stretch is not? NLP techniques are opinionated about what language is and how it works; as a consequence, you’ll sometimes find yourself having to conceptualize your text with uncomfortable abstractions in order to make it work with NLP. (This is especially true of poetry, which almost by definition breaks most “conventional” definitions of how language behaves and how it’s structured.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a computer can never really fully “understand” human language. Even when the text you’re using fits the abstractions of NLP perfectly, the results of NLP analysis are always going to be at least a little bit inaccurate. But often even inaccurate results can be “good enough”—and in any case, inaccurate output from NLP procedures can be an excellent source of the sublime and absurd juxtapositions that we (as poets) are constantly in search of.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Language support\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, most NLP researchers have focused their efforts on English specifically. But many natural language processing libraries now support a wide range of languages. You can find the full [list of supported languages](https://spacy.io/usage/models#languages) on their website, though the robustness of these models varies from one language to the next, as does the specifics of how the model works. (For example, different languages have different ideas about what a \"part of speech\" is.) The examples in this notebook are primarily in English. If you're having trouble applying these techniques to other languages, send me an e-mail—I'd be happy to help you figure out how to get things working for languages other than English!\n",
    "\n",
    "## English grammar: a crash course\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing I believe about English grammar is [this](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/creeley-on-sentence.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Oh yes, the sentence,\" Creeley once told the critic Burton Hatlen, \"that's\n",
    "> what we call it when we put someone in jail.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no such thing as a sentence, or a phrase, or a part of speech, or even\n",
    "a \"word\"---these are all pareidolic fantasies occasioned by glints of sunlight\n",
    "we see on reflected on the surface of the ocean of language; fantasies that we\n",
    "comfort ourselves with when faced with language's infinite and unknowable\n",
    "variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, we may find it occasionally helpful to think about language using\n",
    "these abstractions. The following is a gross oversimplification of both how\n",
    "English grammar works, and how theories of English grammar work in the context\n",
    "of NLP. But it should be enough to get us going!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentences and parts of speech\n",
    "\n",
    "English texts can roughly be divided into \"sentences.\" Sentences are themselves\n",
    "composed of individual words, each of which has a function in expressing the\n",
    "meaning of the sentence. The function of a word in a sentence is called its\n",
    "\"part of speech\"—i.e., a word functions as a noun, a verb, an adjective, etc.\n",
    "Here's a sentence, with words marked for their part of speech:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I       really love entrees       from        the        new       cafeteria.\n",
    "    pronoun adverb verb noun (plural) preposition determiner adjective noun\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the \"part of speech\" of a word isn't a property of the word itself.\n",
    "We know this because a single \"word\" can function as two different parts of speech:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I love cheese.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"love\" here is a verb. But here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Love is a battlefield.\n",
    "\n",
    "... it's a noun. For this reason (and others), it's difficult for computers to\n",
    "accurately determine the part of speech for a word in a sentence. (It's\n",
    "difficult sometimes even for humans to do this.) But NLP procedures do their\n",
    "best!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phrases and larger syntactic structures\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways for talking about larger syntactic structures in sentences. The scheme used by spaCy is called a \"dependency grammar.\" We'll talk about the details of this below."

    "The spaCy library parses the underlying sentences using a [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar). Dependency grammars look different from the kinds of sentence diagramming you may have done in high school, and even from tree-based [phrase structure grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar) commonly used in descriptive linguistics. The idea of a dependency grammar is that every word in a sentence is a \"dependent\" of some other word, which is that word's \"head.\" Those \"head\" words are in turn dependents of other words. The finite verb in the sentence is the ultimate \"head\" of the sentence, and is not itself dependent on any other word. The dependents of a particular head are sometimes called its \"children.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to know what constitutes a \"head\" and a \"dependent\" is complicated. For more details, consult [Dependency Grammar and Dependency Parsing](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/~nivre/docs/05133.pdf). But here are some simple guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A head determines the syntactic category of a phrase as a whole, and can often stand in for the phrase.\n",
    "* The meaning of a phrase comes primarily from its head. The dependents further specify the meaning, but don't determine it.\n",
    "* Heads are obligatory, while dependents are often optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the sentence \"Large contented bears hibernate peacefully,\" *bears* is the head (a noun in this case) and *large* and *contented* are dependents (adjectives). The head of the phrase *large contented bears* is a noun, so the entire phrase is a noun. You could also rewrite the sentence to omit the dependents altogether, and it would still make sense: \"Bears hibernate peacefully.\" Likewise, the adverb *peacefully* is a dependent of the head *hibernate*; the sentence could be rewritten as simply \"Bears hibernate.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Dependents are related to their heads by a *syntactic relation*. The name of the syntactic relation describes the relationship between the head and the dependent. Every token object in a spaCy document or sentence has attributes that tell you what the word's head is, what the dependency relationship is between that word and its head, and a list of that word's children (dependents).\n",
    "\n",
    "The developers of spaCy included a little tool for visualizing the dependency relations of a particular sentence. Let's look at the sentence \"I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox\" as an example:"
