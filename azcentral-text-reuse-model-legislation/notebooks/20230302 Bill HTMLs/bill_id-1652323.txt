Legislative
findings
and
intent.
16


The
general
assembly
is
deeply
concerned
and
does
not
17


support
boycotts
and
related
tactics
that
have
become
a
tool
18


of
economic
warfare
against
numerous
essential
industries,
19


including
fossil
fuel
production,
agriculture,
timber
20


production,
and
firearms,
by
corporations
and
public
and
21


private
institutional
investors
and
proxy
advisors
in
support
22


of
environmental,
social,
and
governance
goals
often
at
odds
23


with
prudent
financial
management.
Therefore,
the
general
24


assembly
intends
that
public
entities
and
public
funds,
when
25


financially
prudent,
should
avoid
doing
business
with
companies
26


and
investors
that
engage
in
such
economic
warfare,
and
27


threaten
harm
to
this
state,
its
businesses,
and
citizens.

to
further
environmental,
20


social,

goals
related
to
those
characteristics
of
21


a
protected
company
under
the
bill.
22


As
to
public
funds,
the

23


granting
proxy
voting
authority
to
a
person
or
entering

24


an
agreement
with
an

to
act
solely
in
the
26


financial
interest
of
participants
and
beneficiaries
of
the
27


public
fund
and
not
based
upon
improper
financial
factors.
The
28


bill
also
requires

all
proxy
votes
on
behalf
of
29


a
public
fund
to
be
posted
on
a
publicly
available
internet
30


site
of
the
public
fund.
Finally,
the
bill
provides
that
the
31


restrictions
on
a
public

do
not
apply

32


determines
that
no
economically
practicable
alternative
is
33


available.

entities,

of
this
Code
section
11

otherwise
be
inconsistent
with
the
public
entity’s

constitutional

statutory

would
prevent
the
public
13


entity

in
an
economically
practicable
manner.
