By: Representative Hobgood-Wilkes
House Bill 1144
AN ACT TO CREATE THE TITLE IX PRESERVATION ACT; TO STATE
LEGISLATIVE INTENT; TO PROVIDE INTERPRETATION AND CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN TERMS
RELATING TO TITLE IX OF THE FEDERAL CODE; TO CLARIFY TERMS FOR THE PURPOSES OF STATE
LAW; TO PROVIDE THAT POLICIES AND LAWS THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE SEXES ARE
SUBJECT TO INTERMEDIATE CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY; TO REQUIRE ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL,
SCHOOL DISTRICT, STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY, DEPARTMENT, OR OFFICE THAT COLLECTS
VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS OR
FOR THE PURPOSE OF GATHERING ACCURATE PUBLIC HEALTH, CRIME, ECONOMIC OR OTHER
DATA TO IDENTIFY EACH INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PART OF THE COLLECTED DATA SET AS
EITHER MALE OR FEMALE AT BIRTH; AND FOR RELATED PURPOSES.
     BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE
OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:
     SECTION 1.  This
act shall be known and may be cited as "Title IX Preservation Act."
     SECTION 2.  The
Legislature finds that: 
          (a) Males and females
possess unique and immutable biological differences that manifest prior to
birth and increase as they age and experience puberty;
          (b)  Biological
differences between the sexes means that only females are able to get pregnant,
give birth, and breastfeed children;
          (c) Biological
differences between the sexes means that males are, on average, bigger,
stronger, and faster than females;
          (d) Biological
differences between the sexes leave females more physically vulnerable than
males to specific forms of violence, including sexual violence;
          (e) Females have
historically suffered from discrimination in education, athletics, and
employment;
          (f) Biological
differences between the sexes are enduring and may, in some circumstances,
warrant the creation of separate social, educational, athletic, or other spaces
in order to ensure safety and/or to allow members of each sex to succeed and
thrive; and 
          (g) Inconsistencies in
court rulings and policy initiatives with respect to the definitions of "sex,"
"male," "female," "man," and "woman"
have led to endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources, thereby necessitating
clarification of certain terms.
     SECTION 3.  For
purposes of state law:
          (a) A person's "sex"
is defined as his or her biological sex, either male or female, at birth;
          (b) A "female"
is an individual whose biological reproductive system is developed to produce
ova; a "male" is an individual whose biological reproductive system
is developed to fertilize the ova of a female;
          (c) "Woman"
and "girl" refer to human females, and the terms "man" and "boy"
refer to human males;
          (d)  The word "mother"
is defined as a parent of the female sex and "father" is defined as a
parent of the male sex;
          (e)  When it comes to
sex, "equal" does not mean "same" or "identical";
and
          (f) When it comes to
sex, separate is not inherently unequal.
     SECTION 4.  There
are legitimate reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to
athletics, prisons or other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters,
rape crisis centers, locker rooms, restrooms, and other areas where biology,
safety, and/or privacy are implicated.
     SECTION 5.  Policies
and laws that distinguish between the sexes are subject to intermediate
constitutional scrutiny, which forbids unfair discrimination against similarly-situated
males and females but allows the law to distinguish between the sexes where
such distinctions are substantially related to important governmental
objectives.
     SECTION 6.  Any
public school or school district and any state or local agency, department, or
office that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with anti-discrimination
laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime, economic or
other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set
as either male or female at birth.
     SECTION 7.  This act
shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 2023.
