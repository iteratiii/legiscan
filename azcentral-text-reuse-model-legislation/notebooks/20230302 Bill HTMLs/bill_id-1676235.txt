Family Code.



 
			
       (e)  A school district employee may not discourage or 



 
			
prohibit parental knowledge of or involvement in critical decisions

well-being.

incurred in obtaining relief under this section, including court 



 
			
costs, reasonable attorney's fees, investigative costs, witness 



 
			
fees, and deposition costs.



 
			
       (k)  Sovereign immunity to suit is waived and abolished to 



 
			
the extent of liability created by this section.



 
			
       (l)  This section may not be construed to limit or alter the 



 
			
requirements of Section 38.004 of this code or Chapter 261, Family 



 
			
Code.
