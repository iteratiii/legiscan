Section 44-140-20.(A)Except as provided in subsection (B), no person shall knowingly perform, or engage in conduct that aids or abets any of the following practices to be performed, upon a minor if the practice is performed for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor's perception of the minor's gender or sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor's sex as defined in this chapter:

(2)prescribing, dispensing, administering, or otherwise supplying supraphysiologic doses of testosterone or other androgens to females;
(3)prescribing, dispensing, administering, or otherwise supplying supraphysiologic doses of estrogen to males;
(4)performing surgeries that sterilize, including castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy;
(5)performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the individual's sex, including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty; or
(6)removing any healthy or nondiseased body part or tissue. 
(B)(1)Subsection (A) does not apply to a procedure undertaken to treat a minor born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development, including either of the following:
(a)an individual born with external biological sex characteristics that are ambiguous and the ambiguity is unresolvable, including an individual born with forty-six XX chromosomes with virilization, forty-six XY chromosomes with undervirilization, or having both ovarian and testicular tissue; or
(b)an individual whom a physician has otherwise diagnosed with a disorder of sexual development, in which the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a male or female.
(2) Subsection (A) does not apply to a medical procedure undertaken to treat a minor for a condition that is a consequence of undergoing a prohibited practice prior to the effective date of this chapter, including, but not limited to, an infection resulting from gender-transition surgery.

SECTION 4.If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this act is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not affect the constitutionality or validity of the remaining portions of this act, the General Assembly hereby declaring that it would have passed this act, and each and every section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise ineffective.
