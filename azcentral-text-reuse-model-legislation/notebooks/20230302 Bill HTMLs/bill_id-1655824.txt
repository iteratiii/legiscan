             (1)  encourage a student to discuss issues relating to

a school district shall provide to the parent of each student 



 
			
enrolled in the district written notice of each health-related 



 
			
service offered at the district campus the student attends.  The 



 
			
notice must include a statement of the parent's right to withhold 



 
			
consent for or decline a health-related service.  A parent's 



 
			
consent to a health-related service does not waive a requirement of

student, a school district must provide a copy of the form to the
