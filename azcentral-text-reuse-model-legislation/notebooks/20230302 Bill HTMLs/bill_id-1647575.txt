METHODOLOGY:This bill adds sexual reassignment, except in cases of ambiguous genitalia, to the list of conduct that constitutes abuse under RSA 169-C, the Child Protection Act.  The Department of Health and Human Services does not have any information to assess the potential fiscal impact, so the impact on child abuse cases and any related litigation costs is indeterminable.  This bill may have an impact on the New Hampshire judicial and correctional systems.  There is no method to determine how many additional charges would be brought as a result of the bill to determine the impact on expenditures.  However, the entities impacted have provided the potential costs associated with these penalties below.

It should be noted that a person needs to be found indigent and have the potential of being incarcerated to be eligible for indigent defense services. Historically, approximately 85% of the indigent defense caseload has been handled by the public defender program, with the remaining cases going to contract attorneys (14%) or assigned counsel (1%). Beginning in March of 2021, the public defender program has had to close intake of new cases due to excessive caseloads. Due to these closures, the contract and assigned counsel program have had to absorb significantly more cases. The system is experiencing significant delays in appointing counsel and the costs of representation have increased due to travel time and multiple appointments.

Department of CorrectionsFY 2023FY 2024

FY 2022 Average Cost of Incarcerating an Individual$64,223$64,223

FY 2022 Annual Marginal Cost of a General Population Inmate$6,123$6,123

FY 2022 Average Cost of Supervising an Individual on Parole/Probation$688$688

The Department notes any increase in the incarcerated population will have a direct impact on overtime costs given the Department’s history of challenges associated with recruitment. In addition, the NH State Prison for Men has a degrading infrastructure which will only be exacerbated if an increase in the incarcerated population were to occur.

County Prosecution CostsIndeterminableIndeterminable

Estimated Average Daily Cost of Incarcerating an Individual$105 to $125$105 to $125

  Many offenses are prosecuted by local and county prosecutors.  When the Department of Justice has investigative and prosecutorial responsibility or is involved in an appeal, the Department may be able to absorb the cost within its existing budget.  However, if the Department needs to prosecute significantly more cases or handle more appeals, then costs will increase by an indeterminable amount.   AGENCIES CONTACTED:Department of Health and Human Services, Judicial Branch, Departments of Corrections and Justice, Judicial Council, and New Hampshire Association of Counties
