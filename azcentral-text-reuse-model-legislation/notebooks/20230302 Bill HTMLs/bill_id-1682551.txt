     SECTION 9.  Section
37-3-49, Mississippi Code of 1972, is amended as follows:
     37-3-49.  (1)  The State
Department of Education shall provide an instructional program and establish
guidelines and procedures for managing such program in the public schools
within the school districts throughout the state as part of the State Program of
Educational Accountability and Assessment of Performance as prescribed in
Section 37-3-46.  Public school districts may (a) elect to adopt the
instructional program and management system provided by the State Department of
Education, or (b) elect to adopt an instructional program and management system
which meets or exceeds criteria established by the State Department of
Education for such.  This provision shall begin with the courses taught in
Grades K-8 which contain skills tested through the Mississippi Basic Skills
Assessment Program and shall proceed through all secondary school courses
mandated for graduation and all secondary school courses in the Mississippi end-of-course
testing program.  Other state core objectives must be included in the district's
instructional program as they are provided by the State Department of Education
along with instructional practices, resources, evaluation items and management
procedures.  Districts are encouraged to adapt this program and accompanying
procedures to all other instructional areas.  The department shall provide that
such program and guidelines, or a program and guidelines developed by a local
school district which incorporates the core objectives from the curriculum
structure are enforced through the performance-based accreditation system.  It
is the intent of the Legislature that every effort be made to protect the
instructional time in the classroom and reduce the amount of paperwork which
must be completed by teachers.  The State Department of Education shall take
steps to insure that school districts properly use staff development time to
work on the districts' instructional management plans.
     (2)  The State Department of
Education shall provide such instructional program and management guidelines
which shall require for every public school district that:
          (a)  All courses taught
in Grades K-8 which contain skills which are tested through the Mississippi
Basic Skills Assessment Program, all secondary school courses mandated for
graduation, and all courses in the end-of-course testing program shall include
the State Department of Education's written list of learning objectives.
          (b)  The local school
board must adopt the objectives that will form the core curriculum which will
be systematically delivered throughout the district.
          (c)  The set of
objectives provided by the State Department of Education must be accompanied by
suggested instructional practices and resources that would help teachers
organize instruction so as to promote student learning of the objectives. 
Objectives added by the school district must also be accompanied by suggested
instructional practices and resources that would help teachers organize
instruction.  The instructional practices and resources that are identified are
to be used as suggestions and not as requirements that teachers must follow. 
The goal of the program is to have students to achieve the desired objective
and not to limit teachers in the way they teach.
          (d)  Standards for
student performance must be established for each core objective in the local
program and those standards establish the district's definition of mastery for
each objective.
          (e)  There shall be an
annual review of student performance in the instructional program against
locally established standards.  When weaknesses exist in the local
instructional program, the district shall take action to improve student
performance.
     (3)  The parent of each
public school student has the right to receive effective communication from the
school principal as to the manner in which instructional materials are used to
implement the school's curricular objectives, in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5 of this act.
     ( * * *34)  The State Board of Education and
the board of trustees of each school district shall adopt policies to limit and
reduce the number and length of written reports that classroom teachers are
required to prepare.
     ( * * *45)  This section shall not be construed
to limit teachers from using their own professional skills to help students
master instructional objectives, nor shall it be construed as a call for more
detailed or complex lesson plans or any increase in testing at the local school
district level.
     ( * * *56)  Districts meeting the highest
levels of accreditation standards, as defined by the State Board of Education,
shall be exempted from the provisions of subsection (2) of this section.  
     SECTION 10.  Section
37-13-173, Mississippi Code of 1972, is amended as follows:
     37-13-173.  (1)  Each
school providing instruction or any other presentation on human sexuality in the
classroom, assembly or other official setting shall be required to provide no less
than * * *one (1) week's
three (3) days' written notice thereof to the parents of children in such
programs of instruction.  The written notice must inform the parents of their right
to request the inclusion of their child for such instruction or presentation.  The
notice also must inform the parents of the right, and the appropriate process, to
review the curriculum and all materials to be used in the lesson or presentation.
     (2)  Upon the written
request of any parent or legal guardian to the school principal to exempt his
or her child from the teaching of reproductive health or any disease, including
HIV/AIDS, in accordance with the provisions of Section 37-13-171, the school
shall excuse the parent's child from such instruction or presentation, without detriment
to the student.
     SECTION 11.  Section
37-15-3, Mississippi Code of 1972, is amended as follows:
     37-15-3.  (1) * * *Such The cumulative folders as are

are in attendance.  Both the permanent records and the cumulative folders shall
be available to school officials, including teachers within the school district
who have been determined by the school district to have legitimate educational
interests.  In no case, however, shall such records be available to the general
public.
     (2)  The rights of
students and their parents or legal guardians with respect to education records
created, maintained, or used by public educational institutions and agencies
shall be protected.  Transcripts of courses and grades may be furnished
when requested by the parent or guardian or eligible pupil as prescribed in the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 20 USCS Section
1232g, the implementing regulations issued pursuant thereto, and this section,
provided the following:
          (a)  Students

cumulative folder shall be furnished to the head of the school to which the
pupil transfers; if a pupil transfers to a private school, then a copy of the
cumulative folder shall be furnished to the head of the school to which the
pupil transfers.  The permanent record shall be kept permanently by the school
district from which the pupil transferred.
     (4)  At no time may a
permanent record of a student be destroyed, but cumulative folders may be
destroyed by order of the school board of the school district in not less than
five (5) years after the permanent record of the pupil has become inactive and
has been transferred to the central depository of the district.  * * *Provided, However, * * *that where a school district makes complete
copies of inactive permanent records on photographic film, microfilm * * *, or any other acceptable form of medium for
storage which may be reproduced as needed, * * *such those permanent records may be
destroyed after the photographic film or microfilm copy has been stored in the
central depository of the district.

any school-related activity or event, or for conduct occurring on property
other than school property or other than at a school-related activity or event
when such conduct by a pupil, in the determination of the school superintendent
or principal, renders that pupil's presence in the classroom a disruption to
the educational environment of the school or a detriment to the best interest
and welfare of the pupils and teacher of such class as a whole, and to delegate
such authority to the appropriate officials of the school district;
          (f)  To visit schools

          (o)  To make orders
directed to the superintendent of schools for the issuance of pay certificates for
lawful purposes on any available funds of the district and to have full control
of the receipt, distribution, allotment and disbursement of all funds provided
for the support and operation of the schools of such school district whether
such funds be derived from state appropriations, local ad valorem tax collections,
or otherwise.  The local school board shall be authorized and empowered to
promulgate rules and regulations that specify the types of claims and set
limits of the dollar amount for payment of claims by the superintendent of
schools to be ratified by the board at the next regularly scheduled meeting
after payment has been made;
          (p)  To select all

          (q)  To provide athletic
programs and other school activities and to regulate the establishment and
operation of such programs and activities;
          (r)  To join, in their
discretion, any association of school boards and other public school-related

any membership dues;
          (s)  To expend local
school activity funds, or other available school district funds, other than
minimum education program funds, for the purposes prescribed under this paragraph. 
"Activity funds" shall mean all funds received by school officials in
all school districts paid or collected to participate in any school activity,
such activity being part of the school program and partially financed with
public funds or supplemented by public funds.  The term "activity funds"
shall not include any funds raised and/or expended by any organization unless
commingled in a bank account with existing activity funds, regardless of
whether the funds were raised by school employees or received by school
employees during school hours or using school facilities, and regardless of
whether a school employee exercises influence over the expenditure or
disposition of such funds.  Organizations shall not be required to make any
payment to any school for the use of any school facility if, in the discretion
of the local school governing board, the organization's function shall be deemed
to be beneficial to the official or extracurricular programs of the school. 
For the purposes of this provision, the term "organization" shall not
include any organization subject to the control of the local school governing
board.  Activity funds may only be expended for any necessary expenses or travel
costs, including advances, incurred by students and their chaperons in attending
any in-state or out-of-state school-related programs, conventions or seminars
and/or any commodities, equipment, travel expenses, purchased services or
school supplies which the local school governing board, in its discretion,
shall deem beneficial to the official or extracurricular programs of the
district, including items which may subsequently become the personal property
of individuals, including yearbooks, athletic apparel, book covers and
trophies.  Activity funds may be used to pay travel expenses of school district
personnel.  The local school governing board shall be authorized and empowered
to promulgate rules and regulations specifically designating for what purposes
school activity funds may be expended.  The local school governing board shall
provide (i) that such school activity funds shall be maintained and expended by
the principal of the school generating the funds in individual bank accounts,
or (ii) that such school activity funds shall be maintained and expended by the
superintendent of schools in a central depository approved by the board.  The
local school governing board shall provide that such school activity funds be
audited as part of the annual audit required in Section 37-9-18.  The State
Department of Education shall prescribe a uniform system of accounting and
financial reporting for all school activity fund transactions;
          (t)  To enter into an
energy performance contract, energy services contract, on a shared-savings,
lease or lease-purchase basis, for energy efficiency services and/or equipment
as provided for in Section 31-7-14;
          (u)  To maintain
accounts and issue pay certificates on school food service bank accounts;
          (v)  (i)  To lease a
school building from an individual, partnership, nonprofit corporation or a
private for-profit corporation for the use of such school district, and to
expend funds therefor as may be available from any nonminimum program sources. 
The school board of the school district desiring to lease a school building
shall declare by resolution that a need exists for a school building and that
the school district cannot provide the necessary funds to pay the cost or its proportionate
share of the cost of a school building required to meet the present needs.  The
resolution so adopted by the school board shall be published once each week for
three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the
school district involved, with the first publication thereof to be made not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the date upon which the school board is to
act on the question of leasing a school building.  If no petition requesting an
election is filed prior to such meeting as hereinafter provided, then the school
board may, by resolution spread upon its minutes, proceed to lease a school
building.  If at any time prior to said meeting a petition signed by not less
than twenty percent (20%) or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is less, of the
qualified electors of the school district involved shall be filed with the
school board requesting that an election be called on the question, then the
school board shall, not later than the next regular meeting, adopt a resolution
calling an election to be held within such school district upon the question of
authorizing the school board to lease a school building.  Such election shall
be called and held, and notice thereof shall be given, in the same manner for
elections upon the questions of the issuance of the bonds of school districts,
and the results thereof shall be certified to the school board.  If at least
three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of the school district who voted
in such election shall vote in favor of the leasing of a school building, then
the school board shall proceed to lease a school building.  The term of the
lease contract shall not exceed twenty (20) years, and the total cost of such
lease shall be either the amount of the lowest and best bid accepted by the
school board after advertisement for bids or an amount not to exceed the
current fair market value of the lease as determined by the averaging of at
least two (2) appraisals by certified general appraisers licensed by the State
of Mississippi.  The term "school building" as used in this paragraph
(v)(i) shall be construed to mean any building or buildings used for classroom
purposes in connection with the operation of schools and shall include the site
therefor, necessary support facilities, and the equipment thereof and
appurtenances thereto such as heating facilities, water supply, sewage
disposal, landscaping, walks, drives and playgrounds.  The term "lease"
as used in this paragraph (v)(i) may include a lease-purchase contract;
              (ii)  If two (2) or
more school districts propose to enter into a lease contract jointly, then
joint meetings of the school boards having control may be held but no action
taken shall be binding on any such school district unless the question of leasing
a school building is approved in each participating school district under the
procedure hereinabove set forth in paragraph (v)(i).  All of the provisions of
paragraph (v)(i) regarding the term and amount of the lease contract shall
apply to the school boards of school districts acting jointly.  Any lease contract
executed by two (2) or more school districts as joint lessees shall set out the
amount of the aggregate lease rental to be paid by each, which may be agreed
upon, but there shall be no right of occupancy by any lessee unless the
aggregate rental is paid as stipulated in the lease contract.  All rights of
joint lessees under the lease contract shall be in proportion to the amount of
lease rental paid by each;
          (w)  To employ all
noninstructional and noncertificated employees and fix the duties and compensation
of such personnel deemed necessary pursuant to the recommendation of the
superintendent of schools;
          (x)  To employ and fix
the duties and compensation of such legal counsel as deemed necessary;
          (y)  Subject to rules
and regulations of the State Board of Education, to purchase, own and operate
trucks, vans and other motor vehicles, which shall bear the proper
identification required by law;
          (z)  To expend funds
for the payment of substitute teachers and to adopt reasonable regulations for
the employment and compensation of such substitute teachers;
          (aa)  To acquire in its
own name by purchase all real property which shall be necessary and desirable
in connection with the construction, renovation or improvement of any public
school building or structure.  Whenever the purchase price for such real
property is greater than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), the school board
shall not purchase the property for an amount exceeding the fair market value
of such property as determined by the average of at least two (2) independent
appraisals by certified general appraisers licensed by the State of
Mississippi.  If the board shall be unable to agree with the owner of any such
real property in connection with any such project, the board shall have the power
and authority to acquire any such real property by condemnation proceedings
pursuant to Section 11-27-1 et seq., Mississippi Code of 1972, and for such
purpose, the right of eminent domain is hereby conferred upon and vested in
said board.  Provided further, that the local school board is authorized to
grant an easement for ingress and egress over sixteenth section land or lieu
land in exchange for a similar easement upon adjoining land where the exchange
of easements affords substantial benefit to the sixteenth section land;
provided, however, the exchange must be based upon values as determined by a
competent appraiser, with any differential in value to be adjusted by cash
payment.  Any easement rights granted over sixteenth section land under such authority
shall terminate when the easement ceases to be used for its stated purpose.  No
sixteenth section or lieu land which is subject to an existing lease shall be burdened
by any such easement except by consent of the lessee or unless the school district
shall acquire the unexpired leasehold interest affected by the easement;
          (bb)  To charge
reasonable fees related to the educational programs of the district, in the
manner prescribed in Section 37-7-335;
          (cc)  Subject to rules
and regulations of the State Board of Education, to purchase relocatable
classrooms for the use of such school district, in the manner prescribed in
Section 37-1-13;
          (dd)  Enter into contracts
or agreements with other school districts, political subdivisions or
governmental entities to carry out one or more of the powers or duties of the
school board, or to allow more efficient utilization of limited resources for
providing services to the public;
          (ee)  To provide for in-service
training for employees of the district;
          (ff)  As part of their
duties to prescribe the use of textbooks, to provide that parents and legal
guardians shall be responsible for the textbooks and for the compensation to
the school district for any books which are not returned to the proper schools
upon the withdrawal of their dependent child.  If a textbook is lost or not
returned by any student who drops out of the public school district, the parent
or legal guardian shall also compensate the school district for the fair market
value of the textbooks;
          (gg)  To conduct fund-raising
activities on behalf of the school district that the local school board, in its
discretion, deems appropriate or beneficial to the official or extracurricular
programs of the district; provided that:
              (i)  Any proceeds of
the fund-raising activities shall be treated as "activity funds" and
shall be accounted for as are other activity funds under this section; and
              (ii)  Fund-raising
activities conducted or authorized by the board for the sale of school
pictures, the rental of caps and gowns or the sale of graduation invitations
for which the school board receives a commission, rebate or fee shall contain a
disclosure statement advising that a portion of the proceeds of the sales or
rentals shall be contributed to the student activity fund;
          (hh)  To allow
individual lessons for music, art and other curriculum-related activities for
academic credit or nonacademic credit during school hours and using school
equipment and facilities, subject to uniform rules and regulations adopted by
the school board;
          (ii)  To charge
reasonable fees for participating in an extracurricular activity for academic
or nonacademic credit for necessary and required equipment such as safety equipment,
band instruments and uniforms;
          (jj)  To conduct or
participate in any fund-raising activities on behalf of or in connection with a
tax-exempt charitable organization;
          (kk)  To exercise such
powers as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this
section;
          (ll)  To expend funds for
the services of nonprofit arts organizations or other such nonprofit organizations
who provide performances or other services for the students of the school
district;
          (mm)  To expend federal
No Child Left Behind Act funds, or any other available funds that are expressly
designated and authorized for that use, to pay training, educational expenses,
salary incentives and salary supplements to employees of local school districts;
except that incentives shall not be considered part of the local supplement as defined
in Section 37-151-5(o), nor shall incentives be considered part of the local
supplement paid to an individual teacher for the purposes of Section 37-19-7(1). 
Mississippi Adequate Education Program funds or any other state funds may not
be used for salary incentives or salary supplements as provided in this paragraph
(mm);
          (nn)  To use any
available funds, not appropriated or designated for any other purpose, for
reimbursement to the state-licensed employees from both in state and out of
state, who enter into a contract for employment in a school district, for the
expense of moving when the employment necessitates the relocation of the
licensed employee to a different geographical area than that in which the
licensed employee resides before entering into the contract.  The reimbursement
shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the documented actual
expenses incurred in the course of relocating, including the expense of any
professional moving company or persons employed to assist with the move, rented
moving vehicles or equipment, mileage in the amount authorized for county and
municipal employees under Section 25-3-41 if the licensed employee used his
personal vehicle or vehicles for the move, meals and such other expenses
associated with the relocation.  No licensed employee may be reimbursed for moving
expenses under this section on more than one (1) occasion by the same school
district.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the actual
residence to which the licensed employee relocates to be within the boundaries
of the school district that has executed a contract for employment in order for
the licensed employee to be eligible for reimbursement for the moving expenses. 
However, the licensed employee must relocate within the boundaries of the State
of Mississippi.  Any individual receiving relocation assistance through the
Critical Teacher Shortage Act as provided in Section 37-159-5 shall not be
eligible to receive additional relocation funds as authorized in this paragraph;
          (oo)  To use any
available funds, not appropriated or designated for any other purpose, to
reimburse persons who interview for employment as a licensed employee with the
district for the mileage and other actual expenses incurred in the course of travel
to and from the interview at the rate authorized for county and municipal
employees under Section 25-3-41;
          (pp)  Consistent with
the report of the Task Force to Conduct a Best Financial Management Practices
Review, to improve school district management and use of resources and identify
cost savings as established in Section 8 of Chapter 610, Laws of 2002, local
school boards are encouraged to conduct independent reviews of the management and
efficiency of schools and school districts.  Such management and efficiency
reviews shall provide state and local officials and the public with the
following:
              (i)  An assessment
of a school district's governance and organizational structure;
              (ii)  An assessment
of the school district's financial and personnel management; 
              (iii)  An
assessment of revenue levels and sources;
              (iv)  An assessment
of facilities utilization, planning and maintenance;
              (v)  An assessment
of food services, transportation and safety/security systems;
              (vi)  An assessment
of instructional and administrative technology;
              (vii)  A review of
the instructional management and the efficiency and effectiveness of existing
instructional programs; and
              (viii)  Recommended
methods for increasing efficiency and effectiveness in providing educational
services to the public; 
          (qq)  To enter into agreements
with other local school boards for the establishment of an educational service
agency (ESA) to provide for the cooperative needs of the region in which the
school district is located, as provided in Section 37-7-345;  
          (rr)  To implement a
financial literacy program for students in Grades 10 and 11.  The board may
review the national programs and obtain free literature from various nationally
recognized programs.  After review of the different programs, the board may
certify a program that is most appropriate for the school districts' needs.  If
a district implements a financial literacy program, then any student in Grade
10 or 11 may participate in the program.  The financial literacy program shall
include, but is not limited to, instruction in the same areas of personal
business and finance as required under Section 37-1-3(2)(b).  The school board
may coordinate with volunteer teachers from local community organizations, including,
but not limited to, the following:  United States Department of Agriculture
Rural Development, United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Junior Achievement, bankers and other nonprofit organizations.  Nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed as to require school boards to implement a
financial literacy program;
          (ss)  To collaborate
with the State Board of Education, Community Action Agencies or the Department
of Human Services to develop and implement a voluntary program to provide
services for a prekindergarten program that addresses the cognitive, social, and
emotional needs of four-year-old and three-year-old children.  The school board
may utilize any source of available revenue to fund the voluntary program.  Effective with the 2013-2014 school year, to
implement voluntary prekindergarten programs under the Early Learning
Collaborative Act of 2013 pursuant to state funds awarded by the State
Department of Education on a matching basis;
          (tt)  With respect to any lawful, written obligation of a school
district, including, but not limited to, leases (excluding leases of sixteenth
section public school trust land), bonds, notes, or other agreement, to agree
in writing with the obligee that the Department of Revenue or any state agency, department or commission created
under state law may:
              (i)  Withhold all or any part (as agreed by the school
board) of any monies which such local school board is entitled to receive from time
to time under any law and which is in the possession of the Department
of Revenue, or any state agency, department or
commission created under state law; and
              (ii)  Pay the same over to any financial institution,
trustee or other obligee, as directed in writing by the school board, to
satisfy all or part of such obligation of the school district.
     The school board may make such written agreement to
withhold and transfer funds irrevocable for the term of the written obligation
and may include in the written agreement any other terms and provisions
acceptable to the school board.  If the school board files a copy of such written
agreement with the Department of Revenue,
or any state agency, department or commission created under state law then the Department
of Revenue or any state agency, department or
commission created under state law shall immediately make the withholdings
provided in such agreement from the amounts due the local school board and
shall continue to pay the same over to such financial institution, trustee or
obligee for the term of the agreement.
     This paragraph (tt) shall not grant any extra
authority to a school board to issue debt in any amount exceeding statutory
limitations on assessed value of taxable property within such school district or
the statutory limitations on debt maturities, and shall not grant any extra
authority to impose, levy or collect a tax which is not otherwise expressly
provided for, and shall not be construed to apply to sixteenth section public
school trust land;
          (uu)  With respect to any matter or transaction that is
competitively bid by a school district, to accept from any bidder as a good-faith
deposit or bid bond or bid surety, the same type of good-faith deposit or bid
bond or bid surety that may be accepted by the state or any other political
subdivision on similar competitively bid matters or transactions.  This
paragraph (uu) shall not be construed to apply to sixteenth section public
school trust land.  The school board may authorize the investment of any school
district funds in the same kind and manner of investments, including pooled
investments, as any other political subdivision, including community hospitals;
          (vv)  To utilize the alternate method for the conveyance or exchange of
unused school buildings and/or land, reserving a partial or other undivided
interest in the property, as specifically authorized and provided in Section 37-7-485;
          (ww) 
To delegate, privatize or otherwise enter into a contract with private entities

services, transportation, professional development, achievement and
instructional consulting services materials and products, purchasing
cooperatives, insurance, business manager services, auditing and accounting
services, school safety/risk prevention, data processing and student records,
and other staff services; however, the authority under this paragraph does not
apply to the leasing, management or operation of sixteenth section lands. 
Local school districts, working through their regional education service
agency, are encouraged to enter into buying consortia with other member districts
for the purposes of more efficient use of state resources as described in
Section 37-7-345;
          (xx)  To partner with entities,
organizations and corporations for the purpose of benefiting the school
district;
          (yy) 
To borrow funds from the Rural Economic Development Authority for the maintenance
of school buildings;
          (zz) 
To fund and operate voluntary early childhood education programs, defined as

and to use any source of revenue for such early childhood education programs. 
Such programs shall not conflict with the Early Learning Collaborative Act of
2013;
          (aaa) 
To issue and provide for the use of procurement cards by school board members,
superintendents and licensed school personnel consistent with the rules and
regulations of the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration under
Section 31-7-9; and
          (bbb)  To conduct an annual comprehensive evaluation of the
superintendent of schools consistent with the assessment components of paragraph
(pp) of this section and the assessment benchmarks established by the
Mississippi School Board Association to evaluate the success the superintendent
has attained in meeting district goals and objectives, the superintendent's leadership skill and whether
or not the superintendent has established appropriate standards for
performance, is monitoring success and is using data for improvement.
     SECTION 13.  Section
37-13-171, Mississippi Code of 1972, is brought forward as follows:
     37-13-171.  (1)  The local school
board of every public school district shall adopt a policy to implement abstinence-only
or abstinence-plus education into its curriculum by June 30, 2012, which instruction
in those subjects shall be implemented not later than the start of the 2012-2013
school year or the local school board shall adopt the program which has been developed
by the Mississippi Department of Human Services and the Mississippi Department of
Health.  The State Department of Education shall approve each district's curriculum
for sex-related education and shall establish a protocol to be used by districts
to provide continuity in teaching the approved curriculum in a manner that is age,
grade and developmentally appropriate.
     (2)  Abstinence-only education
shall remain the state standard for any sex-related education taught in the public
schools.  For purposes of this section, abstinence-only education includes any type
of instruction or program which, at an appropriate age and grade:
          (a)  Teaches the social,
psychological and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity,
and the likely negative psychological and physical effects of not abstaining;
          (b)  Teaches the harmful
consequences to the child, the child's parents and society that bearing children
out of wedlock is likely to produce, including the health, educational, financial
and other difficulties the child and his or her parents are likely to face, as well
as the inappropriateness of the social and economic burden placed on others;
          (c)  Teaches that unwanted
sexual advances are irresponsible and teaches how to reject sexual advances and
how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances;
          (d)  Teaches that abstinence
from sexual activity before marriage, and fidelity within marriage, is the only
certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and
related health problems.  The instruction or program may include a discussion on
condoms or contraceptives, but only if that discussion includes a factual presentation
of the risks and failure rates of those contraceptives.  In no case shall the instruction
or program include any demonstration of how condoms or other contraceptives are
applied;
          (e)  Teaches the current
state law related to sexual conduct, including forcible rape, statutory rape, paternity
establishment, child support and homosexual activity; and
          (f)  Teaches that a mutually
faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the only appropriate
setting for sexual intercourse.
     (3)  A program or instruction
on sex-related education need not include every component listed in subsection (2)
of this section for abstinence-only education.  However, no program or instruction
under an abstinence-only curriculum may include anything that contradicts the excluded
components.  For purposes of this section, abstinence-plus education includes every
component listed under subsection (2) of this section that is age and grade appropriate,
in addition to any other programmatic or instructional component approved by the
department, which shall not include instruction and demonstrations on the application
and use of condoms.  Abstinence-plus education may discuss other contraceptives,
the nature, causes and effects of sexually transmitted diseases, or the prevention
of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, along with a factual presentation
of the risks and failure rates.
     (4)  Any course containing sex-related
education offered in the public schools shall include instruction in either abstinence-only
or abstinence-plus education.
     (5)  Local school districts,
in their discretion, may host programs designed to teach parents how to discuss
abstinence with their children.
     (6)  There shall be no effort
in either an abstinence-only or an abstinence-plus curriculum to teach that abortion
can be used to prevent the birth of a baby.
     (7)  At all times when sex-related
education is discussed or taught, boys and girls shall be separated according to
gender into different classrooms, sex-related education instruction may not be conducted
when boys and girls are in the company of any students of the opposite gender.
     (8)  This section shall stand
repealed on July 1, 2024.
