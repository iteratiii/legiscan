LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:
     SECTION 1.  (1) 
The Legislature finds:
          (a)  That the decision
to pursue gender reassignment surgery to address a discordance between an
individual's sex and sense of identity should not be performed on minors who
are incapable of comprehending the negative implications and life-altering
difficulties attending to these procedures; and
          (b)  That minors are
unable to fully appreciate the risks and life implications, including permanent
sterility that result from surgical procedures.
     (2)  Therefore, it is the
intent of the Mississippi Legislature, through this act and any regulations and
policies promulgated under it, to protect minors from gender reassignment surgery.
     SECTION 2.  For
the purpose of this act, the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to
them herein unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
          (a)  "Gender
reassignment surgery" means any medical or surgical service that seeks to
surgically alter or remove healthy physical or anatomical characteristics or
features that are typical for the individual's biological sex in order to
instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a
sex different from the individual's biological sex, including without
limitation, genital or nongenital gender reassignment surgery performed for the
purpose of assisting an individual with a gender transition.  "Gender reassignment
surgery" may include, but is not limited to, the following procedures:
               (i)  A mastectomy;

          (b)  "Gender
transition" means the process in which a person goes from identifying with
and living as a gender that corresponds to his or her biological sex to
identifying with and living as a gender different from his or her biological
sex, and may involve social, legal or physical changes.
          (c)  "Medical
professional" means any physician, surgeon, physician assistant, nurse,
clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner, anesthetist, psychiatrist or
medical assistant licensed under Mississippi law.

means the biological state of being female or male, based on sex organs,
chromosomes and endogenous hormone profiles.
     SECTION 3. 
(1)  A person is guilty of performing a gender reassignment surgery upon a minor

to be performed a gender reassignment surgery upon a minor for the purpose of
assisting the minor with a gender transition.
     (2)  Upon conviction, the defendant
is guilty of a felony punishable by a fine of not more than Ten Thousand Dollars
($10,000.00) or by a term of no less than five (5) years nor more than fifteen (15)
years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, or both.
     (3)  Upon conviction, if the
defendant was a medical professional at the time of the offense, the defendant shall
be subject to an enhanced penalty in addition to the penalties provided in subsection
(2) of this section of a fine of not more than Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00)
or by a term of not less than five (5) years nor more than ten (10) years in the
custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, or both.
     SECTION 4.  (1)
 A medical professional who performs, attempts to perform, or causes to be performed
a gender reassignment surgery upon a minor for the purpose of assisting an
individual with a gender transition shall be considered to have engaged in
unprofessional conduct.  After a hearing, the medical professional's licensing
or certifying board shall revoke the licensure of the medical professional if it
was determined that a gender reassignment surgery was performed, was attempted
to be performed or was caused to be performed upon a minor for the purpose of assisting
an individual with a gender transition.
     (2)  The medical
professional shall also be subject to a civil fine of not more than Five
Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per occurrence.
     (3)  The hearing and civil fine
required by this section shall not be contingent on the criminal arrest of the medical
professional or the initiation of criminal proceedings against the medical professional.
     SECTION 5.  Sections
3 and 4 of this act do not apply to the good-faith medical decision of a parent
or guardian of a minor born with a medically verifiable genetic disorder of
sexual development or any medical procedure performed as a result of that good-faith
medical decision, including:
          (a)  A minor with
external biological sex characteristics that are ambiguous and irresolvable,
such as a minor born having 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, 46 XY
chromosomes with undervirilization, or having both ovarian and testicular
tissue; or
          (b)  When a physician
has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development, in which the
physician has determined through genetic testing that the minor does not have
the normal sex chromosome structure for a male or female.
     SECTION 6.  (1)
 Any person harmed by a violation of this act may bring a claim to obtain
injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and any other relief
available under law against a government agent, state office, agency, any
political subdivision of the state, any local government or any other person or
entity responsible for the violation.

(20) years after his disability shall be removed as provided by law.  The
