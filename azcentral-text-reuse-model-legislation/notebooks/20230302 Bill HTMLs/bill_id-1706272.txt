The
inclusion

this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
19


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of

Under
current
law,
Code
section
4.1
sets
forth
certain
21


general
rules
for
the
usage
of
terms
throughout
the
Code.
22


This
bill
defines
the
terms
“gender”
and
“sex”,
when
used
in
23


reference
to
gender,
to
mean
the
biological
sex
designation
of
24


male
or
female
on
a
person’s
birth
certificate.
Therefore,
25


when
a
Code
section
refers
to
gender
or
sex
in
reference
to
26


its
inclusion
on
an
application,
license,
or
other
document
27


(for
example,
Code
section
321.182,
relating
to
driver’s
28


licenses),
the
listed
gender
or
sex
must
comply
with
the

definition.
Current

section
144.23
provides
that
a

30


certificate
of
birth
is
issued
upon
receipt
of
proof
of
a
31


change
in
sex
designation.
32


In
addition,
the
bill
specifies
that
the
state
or
any
33


governmental

is
not
allowed
to
list
a
person’s
gender
or
