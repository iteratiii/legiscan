A BILL TO BE ENTITLED




 
			

AN ACT




 
			
relating to the definition and use of the terms "male" and "female" 



 
			
for purposes of certain government documents.



 
			
       BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:



 
			
       SECTION 1.  FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:



 
			
             (1)  males and females possess unique immutable 



 
			
biological differences that manifest prior to birth and increase as 



 
			
individuals age and experience puberty;



 
			
             (2)  biological differences between the sexes mean that 



 
			
only females are able to get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed 



 
			
children;



 
			
             (3)  biological differences between the sexes mean that 



 
			
males are, on average, bigger, stronger, and faster than females;



 
			
             (4)  biological differences between the sexes leave 



 
			
females more physically vulnerable than males to specific forms of 



 
			
violence, including sexual violence;



 
			
             (5)  females have historically suffered discrimination 



 
			
in education, athletics, and employment;



 
			
             (6)  biological differences between the sexes are 



 
			
enduring and may, in some circumstances, warrant the creation of 



 
			
separate social, educational, athletic, or other spaces in order to 



 
			
ensure individuals' safety and allow members of each sex to succeed 



 
			
and thrive;



 
			
             (7)  inconsistencies in court rulings and policy 



 
			
initiatives with regard to the definitions of "sex," "male," 



 
			
"female," "man," and "woman" have led to endangerment of single-sex 



 
			
spaces and resources, necessitating clarification of certain 



 
			
terms; and



 
			
             (8)  an individual's sex is defined as the individual's 



 
			
biological sex at birth, either male or female.



 
			
       SECTION 2.  Chapter 2051, Government Code, is amended by 



 
			
adding Subchapter G to read as follows:



 
			
SUBCHAPTER G.  DEFINITIONS OF MALE AND FEMALE FOR CERTAIN 



 
			
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, PUBLICATIONS, AND NOTICES



 
			
       Sec. 2051.251.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:



 
			
             (1)  "Female" means an individual whose biological 



 
			
reproductive system is developed to produce ova.



 
			
             (2)  "Governmental entity" has the meaning assigned by 



 
			
Section 2051.041.



 
			
             (3)  "Male" means an individual whose biological 



 
			
reproductive system is developed to fertilize the ova of a female.



 
			
       Sec. 2051.252.  DEFINITIONS OF MALE AND FEMALE FOR CERTAIN 



 
			
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, PUBLICATIONS, AND NOTICES.  A document, 



 
			
policy, survey, questionnaire, report, publication, notice, or 



 
			
other written or electronic material produced by a governmental 



 
			
entity or official may only reference two sexes, male and female, 



 
			
when requesting or providing information regarding a person's sex.



 
			
       SECTION 3.  This Act takes effect September 1, 2023.
