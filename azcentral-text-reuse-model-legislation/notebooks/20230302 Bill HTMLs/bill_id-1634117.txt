CONCURRENT RESOLUTION




 		
			
       WHEREAS, The American Academy of Pediatrics, American 



 
			
Medical Association, and Children's Hospital Association wrote a 



 
			
letter to the United States Attorney General on October 3, 2022, 



 
			
requesting a Department of Justice investigation of organizations, 



 
			
individuals, and entities that advocate against what they term 



 
			
"gender-affirming health care"; and



 
			
       WHEREAS, "Gender-affirming care" is an unconscionable 



 
			
misnomer for the abhorrent practice of genital mutilation and the 



 
			
administration of puberty blockers to children who can not even 



 
			
legally smoke cigarettes; such "care" leads to irreparable harm, 



 
			
psychological damage, and a lifetime of trauma; and



 
			
       WHEREAS, The defenders of "gender-affirming" treatment wish 



 
			
to silence the voices of those who have undergone gender 



 
			
transitions and are left with immense, debilitating regret; they 



 
			
ignore that other countries have examined the issue of whether 



 
			
minors can adequately understand and properly consent to 



 
			
"gender-affirming care"; in a landmark 2020 High Court decision in 



 
			
the United Kingdom, the court ruled that the capacity to legally 



 
			
consent to taking puberty blockers was "highly unlikely" for 



 
			
13-year-olds and "doubtful" for 14- and 15-year-olds; 



 
			
consequently, the use of puberty blockers was suspended for 



 
			
children under the age of 16; and



 
			
       WHEREAS, In July 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 



 
			
issued a warning regarding gonadotropin-releasing hormone 



 
			
agonists, commonly known as puberty blockers; the FDA identified a 



 
			
plausible association between GnRH agonist use and pseudotumor 



 
			
cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which 



 
			
occurs when pressure inside the skull spontaneously increases; the 



 
			
condition can cause brain swelling, severe headaches, nausea, 



 
			
double vision, and even permanent vision loss, according to the 



 
			
Mayo Clinic; and



 
			
       WHEREAS, "Gender-affirming care" is a dangerous practice 



 
			
that destroys lives, and those who would suppress opposition to 



 
			
such treatment are deserving of the harshest censure; now, 



 
			
therefore, be it



 
			
       RESOLVED, That the 88th Legislature of the State of Texas 



 
			
hereby express support for ending "gender-affirming care" and 



 
			
condemn the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical 



 
			
Association, and Children's Hospital Association for their attempt 



 
			
to suppress objections to such treatment.
