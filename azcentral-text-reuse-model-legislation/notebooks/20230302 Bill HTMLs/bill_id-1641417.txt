AN ACT




 
			
relating to parental rights in public education and prohibiting 



 
			
instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity for 



 
			
certain public school students.



 
			
       BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:



 
			
       SECTION 1.  Chapter 26, Education Code, is amended by adding 



 
			
Section 26.0083 to read as follows:



 
			
       Sec. 26.0083.  RIGHT TO INFORMATION REGARDING MENTAL, 



 
			
EMOTIONAL, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES.  (a)  



 
			
Each school district shall adopt a procedure for notifying the 



 
			
parent of a student enrolled in the district regarding any change 



 
			
in:



 
			
             (1)  services provided to or monitoring of the student 



 
			
related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or 



 
			
well-being; or



 
			
             (2)  the district's ability to provide a safe and 



 
			
supportive learning environment for the student. 



 
			
       (b)  A procedure adopted under Subsection (a) must reinforce 



 
			
the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions regarding the 



 
			
upbringing and control of the parent's child by requiring school 



 
			
district personnel to:



 
			
             (1)  encourage a student to discuss issues relating to 



 
			
the student's well-being with the student's parent; or



 
			
             (2)  facilitate a discussion described under 



 
			
Subdivision (1).



 
			
       (c)  A school district may not adopt a procedure or a student 



 
			
support form, including a student well-being questionnaire or 



 
			
health screening form, that:



 
			
             (1)  prohibits a district employee from notifying the 



 
			
parent of a student regarding:



 
			
                   (A)  information about the student's mental, 



 
			
emotional, or physical health or well-being; or



 
			
                   (B)  a change in services provided to or 



 
			
monitoring of the student related to the student's mental, 



 
			
emotional, or physical health or well-being;



 
			
             (2)  encourages or has the effect of encouraging a 



 
			
student to withhold from the student's parent information described 



 
			
by Subdivision (1)(A); or



 
			
             (3)  prevents a parent from accessing education or 



 
			
health records concerning the parent's child.



 
			
       (d)  Subsections (a) and (c) do not require the disclosure of 



 
			
information to a parent if a reasonably prudent person would 



 
			
believe the disclosure is likely to result in the student suffering 



 
			
abuse or neglect, as those terms are defined by Section 261.001, 



 
			
Family Code.



 
			
       (e)  A school district employee may not discourage or 



 
			
prohibit parental knowledge of or involvement in critical decisions 



 
			
affecting a student's mental, emotional, or physical health or 



 
			
well-being.



 
			
       (f)  Any student support services training developed or 



 
			
provided by a school district to district employees must comply 



 
			
with any student services guidelines, standards, and frameworks 



 
			
established by the State Board of Education and the agency.



 
			
       (g)  Before the first instructional day of each school year, 



 
			
a school district shall provide to the parent of each student 



 
			
enrolled in the district written notice of each health-related 



 
			
service offered at the district campus the student attends.  The 



 
			
notice must include a statement of the parent's right to withhold 



 
			
consent for or decline a health-related service.  A parent's 



 
			
consent to a health-related service does not waive a requirement of 



 
			
Subsection (a), (c), or (e). 



 
			
       (h)  Before administering a student well-being questionnaire 



 
			
or health screening form to a student enrolled in kindergarten 



 
			
through eighth grade, a school district must provide a copy of the 



 
			
questionnaire or form to the student's parent and obtain the 



 
			
parent's consent to administer the questionnaire or form.



 
			
       (i)  This section may not be construed to limit or alter the 



 
			
requirements of Section 38.004 of this code or Chapter 261, Family 



 
			
Code.



 
			
       (j)  Not later than August 1, 2024, the agency, the State 



 
			
Board of Education, and the State Board for Educator Certification, 



 
			
as appropriate, shall review and revise as necessary the following 



 
			
to ensure compliance with this section:



 
			
             (1)  school counseling frameworks and standards;



 
			
             (2)  educator practices and professional conduct 



 
			
principles; and



 
			
             (3)  any other student services personnel guidelines, 



 
			
standards, or frameworks.



 
			
       (k)  Subsection (j) and this subsection expire September 1, 



 
			
2025.

employee may not provide or allow a third party to provide
