AN ACT TO ENACT THE TITLE IX PRESERVATION ACT; TO PROVIDE INTERPRETATION
AND CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN TERMS RELATING TO TITLE IX OF THE FEDERAL CODE; TO
STATE LEGISLATIVE INTENT; TO CLARIFY TERMS FOR THE PURPOSES OF STATE LAW; TO
PROVIDE THAT POLICIES AND LAWS THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE SEXES ARE SUBJECT
TO INTERMEDIATE CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY; TO REQUIRE THE STATE OR A LOCAL
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY TO DISAGGREGATE THE DATA OF INDIVIDUALS BY SEX BASED ON THE

ENTITY GATHERS THE DATA OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IS DISAGGREGATED BY SEX; AND FOR
RELATED PURPOSES.
     BE IT ENACTED BY THE
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:
     SECTION 1.  This
act shall be known and may be cited as "The Title IX Preservation Act."
     SECTION 2.  The
Legislature finds and declares that:
          (a)  Males and females
possess unique and immutable biological differences that manifest prior to
birth and increase with age and puberty;
          (b)  Biological
differences between the sexes mean that only females can get pregnant, give
birth and breastfeed children;
          (c)  Biological
differences between the sexes mean that males are, on average, larger in size
and possess greater body strength than females;
          (d)  Whereas biological
differences between the sexes can expose females to greater harm than males
from specific forms of violence, including sexual violence;
          (e)  Females have historically
suffered from discrimination in education, athletics and employment;
          (f)  Females have achieved
inspirational and significant accomplishments in education, athletics and
employment;
     Biological differences between
the sexes are enduring and may, in some circumstances, warrant the creation of separate
social, educational, athletic or other spaces in order to ensure safety and/or to
allow members of each sex to succeed and thrive;
          (g)  When it comes to sex:
               (i)  "Equal"
does not mean "same" or "identical"; and
               (ii)  Separate is not
inherently unequal; and
          (h)  Recent misguided
court rulings and policy initiatives relating to the definition of "sex"
have led to the endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources dedicated to
women, thereby necessitating clarification of certain terms.
     SECTION 3.  For
the purposes of State law:
          (a)  The "sex"
of an individual means his or her biological sex (either male or female) at
birth.
          (b)  The terms "woman"
and "girl" refer to human females.
          (c)  The terms "man"
and "boy" refer to human males.
          (d)  The word "mother"
refers to a parent of the female sex.
          (e)  The word "father"
refers to a parent of the male sex.
     SECTION 4.  (1)
 There are important reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to
athletics, prisons, domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and with respect to
other areas, particularly where biology, safety and privacy are implicated.
     (2)  Policies and laws that
distinguish between the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional
scrutiny and permitted when they serve an important governmental objective and
are substantially related to achieving that objective.
     SECTION 5.  When
the State or a local governmental entity gathers data of individuals that is disaggregated
by sex, the state or local governmental entity shall disaggregate the data of individuals
by sex based on the biological sex of individuals at birth.
     SECTION 6.  Any
person who suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of this
act shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages and any
other relief available under law against the state or its political subdivision
causing the harm.
     SECTION 7.  This act
shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 2023.
