assertions that suggest that morality and truth are man -made 
conventions and  that at the heart of liberty is man ’s ability to  
define his own meaning of the universe.  The term refers to a 
religion that tends to promote licentiousness and to justify 
practices that are inconsistent with the peace and safety of the 
state.  The term r efers to the belief that man is merely a bundle o f

assumptions and naked assertions that are implicitly religious and 
have a tendency to erode community standards of decency and promote

on morality that come from secular humanism ; and

competent jurisdiction.

Oklahoma Constitution, a public school is prohibited fro m creating,

purpose;  
2.  Cultivating indefensible legal weapons against  non-observers 
of the re ligion of secular humanism; and

24  SECTION 6.     NEW LAW     A new section of law to be codified 
in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1-131 of Title 70, unless there 
is created a duplication in numb ering, reads as follows: 
A.  The School Establishment Clause Act (S ECA) is constructed on 
the premise that:  
1.  The United States is a constitutional republic of which  the 
State of Oklahoma is a part; 
2.  The United States Cons titution is the supreme sovereign law 
of this country that preempts all state and federal law;  
3.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution 
applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution;  
4.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution and Article II, Section  5 of the Oklahoma 
Constitution wer e not merely designed to prevent the state from 
respecting and promoting the doctrines of institutionalized 
religions but tho se of non -institutionalized religions ; 
5.  All members of the Legislature  and all executive and 
judicial officers are b ound by oath or affirmation pursuant to 
Article VI, Clause 3  of the United States Constitution to not create

24  6.  The Establishment Clause balanced with the Free Exercise 
Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is 
the controlling constitutional authority in in forming this state  on 
how to respond and react to self -asserted sex -based identity 
narratives and sexual orientation orthodox y and the Equal Protection 
and substantive Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth  Amendment to 
the United States Constitution have no applicability;  
7.  Emotional appeals  shall not be used to usurp the 
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States 
Constitution or Article II, Section 5  of the Oklahoma Constitution 
in an effort to justify the government’s creation or enforcement of 
policies that respect non -secular self -asserted sex -based identity 
narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy;  
8.  All policies put forth by public schools that resp ect or 
recognize non-secular self -asserted sex -based identity narratives 
and sexual orientation orthodoxy fail the lemon test first 
established by the United States Supreme Court and are thereby 
preempted by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution and Article II, S ection 5  of the Oklahoma 
Constitution in their making and enforcement and shall be enjoined 
from enforcement because the policies:  
a. constitute n on-secular shams that lack a primary 
secular purpose;

c. have the effect of excessively entangling the 
government with the religion of secular h umanism;  
9.  The Legislature recognizes that in  the wake of the deci sions 
by the United States Supreme Court that force d the state ’s 
entanglemen t with the religion of secular humanism, there has been 
no rush on non -secular marriage, but there has been a rush on: 
a. public schools and public libraries by devout secular 
humanists for the sole purpose of targeting and 
indoctrinating minors wi th the licentious religion of 
secular humanism with the government ’s stamp of 
approval at the taxpayers ’ expense, and 
b. the social marginalization and systematic persecution 
of non-observers of the religion of secular humanism;  
10.  The Legislature recognizes  that it is not proven or 
disproven whether sexual orientation is predicated on immutability 
and genetics an d is, therefore, a matter of religious faith that 
falls within the exclusive  jurisdiction of the Establishment Clause 
balanced with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution and Article I I, Section 5  of the Oklahoma 
Constitution;  and 
11.  This state  shall be particularly vigilant in monitori ng 
compliance with the Establishment Clause of the United States

religious indoctrination with the government ’s stamp of approval, 
especially when th at religious ideology promotes licentiousn ess. 
B.  SECA shall  not be construe d as prohibiting students or 
teachers from believing in or from ref using to believe in the 
plausibility of non -secular self -asserted sex -based identity 
narratives or sexual orient ation orthodoxy or secular humanist 
practices because such beliefs and practi ces are protected under the 
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and under Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma 
Constitution .  SECA shall  be constructed on the premise that 
protections of religious practices under the Free Exercise Clause of 
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 
II, Section 5  of the Oklahoma Constitution are not absolute, and 
this state is author ized to regulate or prohibit certain relig ious 
practices pursuant to its inhe rent police powers afforded u nder the 
Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution if those practices 
promote licentiousness or are inconsistent with the peace and safety 
of the state.  The Legislature  recognizes tha t it is self-evident 
that non -secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives and 
sexual orie ntation orthodoxy promote licentiousness and attempt s to 
justify practices are inconsistent with the peace and safety  of this 
state.

If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence,

SECTION 8.     NEW LAW      A new section of law not to be

The Legislature hereby recognizes  the following findings : 
1.  The Unite d States Constitution is not silent as to how this 
state shall  respond and react to lesbian, gay,  bisexual, 
transgender, and questioning  (LGBTQ) issues and sexual orientation 
orthodoxy for the matters are addressed exclus ively by the

4.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment  to the

non-institutionalized  religions, such as secular humanism;  
6.  The United States Supreme Court found that secular humanism 
is a religion for  the purposes of the First Amendment in:  
a. Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961) ,

in cases such as:  
a. Malnak v. Yogi, 592 F.2d 197 (3d Cir.1979) ,

that are part of a worldview consisting of a series of unproven 
faith-based assumptions and naked asserti ons that are implicitly 
religious and inse parably linked to the religion of secul ar 
humanism; 
9.  The LGBTQ community is centered on a “closed system ” that is 
organized, full, and provides a comprehensive code by which 
individuals may guide their daily acti vities, making LGBTQ secular 
humanism a r eligion in view of the legal definition  of what 
constitutes a religion provided by the courts i n cases such as 
United States v. Seeger, 380 US 163 (1965); Welsh v. United States,

10.  Instead of having a cross, the Ten Commandments, or the 
star and crescent, the LGBTQ secular humanist religion has the 
rainbow-colored flag to symbolize its rel igious beliefs, practices, 
and value s; 
11.  The beliefs that a person “was born  with a gay gene ” or 
“was born in the wrong body ” and is thereby entitled to special

577 (1992) found  that there are “heightened concerns with protecting 
freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the 
elementary and s econdary public schools, ” while also hold ing in

United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct.  2675 (2013), and Bostock v. 
Clayton Cnty. B d. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019), there has 
not been the promised equality, tolerance, and unity, but instead  
there has been division, domination by secular huma nists, the 
proliferation of moral superio rity complexes by moral relativists, 
cancel culture, the erosion of the integrity of the  legal basis 
supporting the race -based civil rights movement which is objectively 
based on immutability, increased sexual explo itation and 
licentiousness, the prolifera tion of sexual confusion amongst 
minors, and  the marginalization and even violent oppres sion of non -
observers of the religion of secular humanism, demonstrating that 
those decisions amount to some of the greatest no n-secular shams

1599 (2019), Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015) , and United 
States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), the controlli ng 
applicability of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to 
the United States Constitution regarding sexual orientation 
orthodoxy was lurking in the shadows of those cases but not decided 
upon by the Supreme Court, whic h means that Stare Decisis  does not 
apply, and those cases are subjecte d to being overruled for being 
framed on the  wrong constitutional narrative;

24  23.  The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that 
the states have a compelling interest to uphold  community standards 
of decency, to discourage licentiousness, and to enact policies that 
stop attempts to justify  practices that are inconsistent with the 
peace and safety of the state, as underscored by the state ’s 
inherent police powers in the Tenth Amendment to the United Stat es 
Constitution;  
24.  The United States Supre me Court found in Ginsberg v. New 
York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968) and Mishkin v. State of New York, 383 U.S. 
502 (1966) that “to simply adjust the definition of obscenity to 
social realities ha s always failed to be pe rsuasive before the 
Courts of the United Stat es”, and such adjustments fail to be 
persuasive to this state ; 
25.  Courts, in cases like Schlegel v. United States,  416 F. 2d 
1372 (Ct. Cl. 1969), have held as a matter of self -evident 
observation that “any schoolboy knows that a homosexual act is 
immoral, in decent, lewd, and obscene.   Adult persons are even more 
conscious that this is true ”; 
26.  A public school policy that permits self -identified 
transvestites who are biological males to participate in sports for 
biological females in an attemp t to show resp ect to their non -
secular self -asserted sex -based identity narrative fails the three 
prongs of the lemon test by a landslide, promotes licentiousness, 
erodes community standards  of decency, and is an attempt to justify

state; 
27.  The United States Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. 
Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019) was 
invalid because requiring that “sexual orientation ” be read into the 
term “sex” in Title VIII, 42 U. S.C. §2000e–2(a)(1) causes th e 
statute to lack a primary secular purpose and excessively entangles 
the government with the religion of secular humanism as advocated by 
the LGBTQ denominatio n; 
28.  Males and females are self -evidently differ ent but equal as  
implicated by the following neutral and secular considerations:  
a. according to the United States Supreme Court in United 
States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), there 
are “inherent d ifferences betwee n men and women, ” and 
these diffe rences “remain c ause for celebration, but  
not for denigration of the members of either sex or 
for artificial constraints on an individual ’s 
opportunity ”, 
b. these “inherent differences ” range from chromosom al 
and hormonal d ifferences to physiological diffe rences, 
c. according to Neel Burt on, “The Battle of the Sexes, ” 
33 Psychology Today (July 2, 2012), men generally have 
“denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments ” and

Law and Contemporary Problems 63 -126 (2017) (quoting 
Gina Kolata, “Men, Women 2 and Speed. Words: Got 
Testosterone? ”, N.Y. Tim es (Aug. 21, 2008 )), men also 
have higher natural levels of testos terone, which  
affects traits such as hemoglobin levels, body fat 
content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the 
development of type 2 muscle fibers, all of which 
result in men being  able to generate higher speed and 
power during phy sical activity , 
e. the biological differences between men and women, 
especially related to natural levels of testosterone,  
explains the male and female secondary sex 
characteristics which develop during  puberty and have 
life-long effects, including those m ost important fo r 
success in sport: categorically different strength, 
speed, and endurance,  according to Doriane Lambelet 
Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, “Comparing Athletic 
Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men, ”

24  States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), 
recognized that “sex classifications may be used to 
compensate women for particular economic  disabilities 
[they have] suffered, promote equal employment 
opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the 
talent and capacities of our Nation ’s people ”, 
g. one place where sex classifications allow for the 
“full development of the talent and capac ities of our 
Nation’s people ” is in the context of sports and 
athletics , 
h. courts have recognized that the inherent, 
physiological differences between males and females 
result in different athletic ca pabilities.   For 
example, Kleczek v. Rhode Island Inter scholastic 26 
League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ( “Because 
of innate physiological differences, boys and girls 
are not similarly situated as they enter athletic 
competition. ”); Petrie v. I ll. High Sch. Ass ’n, 394 
N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 197 9) (noting tha t 
“high school boys [generally possess physiological 
advantages over] their girl counterparts ” and that 
those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls 
in some sports like “high school track ”),

since 1983 by Valerie Thibault, et al., “Women and Men 
in Sport Performance: The Gender Gap Has Not Evolved 
Since 1983, ” Journal of Sports Science & Medicine, 
Vol. 9, No.2 (2010), fo und that although athletes  from 
both sexes improved over th e time spa n, the “gender 
gap” between female and male performances remained 
stable, which suggests that “women’s performances at 
the high level will never match those of men ”, 
j. as Duke University  School of Law professor a nd all-
American track athlete Dor iane Coleman, te nnis 
champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold 
medalist Sanya Richards -Ross recently wrote, “[T]he 
evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in 
every sport except  sailing, shooting, and ri ding, 
there will al ways be signif icant numbers of  boys and 
men who would beat the best girls and women in head -
to-head competition.   Claims to the contrary are 
simply a denial of science. ” (Doriane Coleman, Martina 
Navratilova, et al., “Pass the Equality A ct, But Don ’t 
Abandon Title IX, ” Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019)) , 
k. the benefits that natural testosterone provides to 
male athletes are not diminished through the use of 
puberty blockers and cross -sex hormones.   A recent

blockers and cross-sex hormon es found that even “after 
12 months of hormonal 17 therapy, ” a man who 
identifies as a woman and is taking cross -sex hormones 
“had an absolute advantage ” over female athletes and 
“will still likely have perf ormance benefits ” over 
women. (Wi lk, Anna, et al. , “Muscle Strength, Size and 
Composition Following 12 Months of Gender -Affirming 
Treatment in Transgender Individuals, ” The Journal of 
Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, Vol. 105, N o. 3 
(2019)), and 
l. having separate sex -specific teams furthers efforts to 
promote sex equality and accomplishes this aim by 
providing opportunities for female athletes to 
demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic 
abilities while also providing them  with opportunities 
to obtain recognition and accolades,  college 
scholars hips, and the numerous other long -term 
benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors.
