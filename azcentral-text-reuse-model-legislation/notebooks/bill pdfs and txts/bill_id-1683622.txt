Sixty-eighth
Legislative Assembly
of North Dakota
Introduced by
Representatives S. Olson, K. Anderson, Henderson, Meier, Novak, Rohr, Steiner, VanWinkle
A concurrent resolution urging public schools and public entities, including agencies or  
departments that collect vital statistics, to protect women's rights by distinguishing between the  
sexes according to biological sex at birth for the purpose of providing equal opportunities and  
ensuring the privacy and safety of women and girls.
WHEREAS, a male and a female possess unique and immutable biological differences that  
manifest prior to birth and increase as the individual ages and experiences puberty; and
WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes mean that only a female is able to  
become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed children; and
WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes mean that a male is, on average,  
bigger, stronger, and faster than a female; and
WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes leave a female more physically  
vulnerable than a male to specific forms of violence, including sexual violence; and
WHEREAS, females have suffered historically from discrimination in education, athletics,  
and employment; and
WHEREAS, when it comes to sex, "equal" does not mean "same" or "identical" and  
separate is not inherently unequal; and
WHEREAS, biological differences between the sexes are enduring and may warrant the  
creation of separate social, educational, athletic, or other spaces to ensure safety or allow  
members of each sex to succeed and thrive; and
WHEREAS, inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with respect to the  
definitions of "sex", "male", "female", "man", and "woman" have led to endangerment of  
single-sex spaces and resources, thereby necessitating clarification of certain terms; and
WHEREAS, there are legitimate reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to  
athletics, prisons and other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape and abuse

crisis centers, locker rooms, restrooms, and other areas where safety and privacy are  
implicated; and
WHEREAS, policies and laws that distinguish between the sexes are subject to  
intermediate constitutional scrutiny, which forbids unfair discrimination against similarly situated  
males and females but allows the law to distinguish between the sexes if distinctions are  
substantially related to important governmental objectives;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF  
NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
That the Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly urges public schools and public entities,  
including agencies or departments that collect vital statistics, to protect women's rights by  
distinguishing between the sexes according to biological sex at birth for the purpose of  
providing equal opportunities and ensuring the privacy and safety of women and girls; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that the Secretary of State forward a copy of this resolution  
to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the superintendent of each school district in the  
state, and the Executive Director of the Department of Health and Human Services.
