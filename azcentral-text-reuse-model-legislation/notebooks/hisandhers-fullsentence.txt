Whereas recent misguided court rulings related to the defini-

Resolved, That the Senate reaffirms that— 
(1) for the purposes of Federal law, the ‘‘sex’’ of an individual means his or her biological sex (either male or female) at birth; 
(2) for the purposes of Federal laws addressing sex, the terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘girl’’ refer to human females, and the terms ‘‘man’’ and ‘‘boy’’ refer to human males; 
(3) for the purposes of Federal law, the word ‘‘mother’’ means a parent of the female sex and ‘‘father’’ is defined as a parent of the male sex;
(4) there are important reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and other areas, particularly where biology, safety, and privacy are implicated;
(5) policies and laws that distinguish between the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional scrutiny and permitted when they serve an important governmental objective and are substantially related to achieving that objective; and (6) for the purposes of complying with Federal laws that require State and local government agencies to collect or report data disaggregated by sex, such as Federal antidiscrimination laws, agencies are required to base such data on the biological sex of individuals at birth.
The General Assembly finds that:
(1) parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children;
(2) important information relating to a child should not be withheld, either inadvertently or purposefully, from his or her parent, including information relating to the child's health, well being, and education, while the child is in the custody of the school district; and
(3) it is necessary to establish a consistent mechanism for parents to be notified of information relating to the health and well being of their children.
The State, political subdivisions of the State, public school districts, other governmental entities, and other institutions shall not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health care of his or her child without demonstrating that the action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest as applied to the parent and child; narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest; and not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.

wholly on an unverified anonymous report; 121
