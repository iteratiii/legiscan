BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA: 11
SECTION 1. 12
The General Assembly finds and declares that:13
(1)  This state has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of 14
its citizens, especially vulnerable children; 1523 LC 33 9320
S. B. 141
- 2 -(2)  Only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying 16
with their biological sex.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence 17
ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent 18
for natal females; 19
(3)  Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender 20
nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to 21
identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most 22
medical health care interventions unnecessary; 23
(4)  Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their 24
biological sex of ten have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these 25
individuals should be encouraged to seek me ntal health care services before undertaking 26
any hormonal or surgical intervention; 27
(5)  Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated 28
above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been 29
performed; 30
(6)  Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay 31
the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in children who experience distress at 32
identifying with their biological sex.  This is being done despite the lack of any long-term 33
longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment 34
of such distress or gender transition; 35
(7)  Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who 36
experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no 37
randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of 38
cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender 39
transition; 40
(8)  The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks: 4123 LC 33 9320
S. B. 141
- 3 -(A)  For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery 42
disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine 43
cancers, and irreversible infertility; and 44
(B)  For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery 45
disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, 46
and irreversible infertility; 47
(9)  Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for 48
children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are 49
becoming more frequent; 50
(10)  Genital gender reassignment surgery incl udes several irreversible  invasive procedures 51
for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and 52
functional body parts: 53
(A)  For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including 54
penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty; and 55
(B)  For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, 56
reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or 57
phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular 58
prostheses; 59
(11)  The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender 60
reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex; 61
(12)  Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for 62
males and females and also involves the alte ration or removal of biologically normal and 63
functional body parts: 64
(A)  For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial 65
feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, 66
gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures; and 6723 LC 33 9320
S. B. 141
- 4 -(B)  For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice 68
surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures; 69
(13)  It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or 70
product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases.  Just 71
between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by 20 percent; 72
(14)  It is of grave concern that the medical community is allowing individuals who 73
experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and 74
drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing 75
genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits 76
of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and 77
(15)  The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of 78
clinical study on these procedures. 79
