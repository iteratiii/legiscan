Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened: 1 Title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Protection Against Child Medical and Psychological Experimentation Act". 2 Legislative Findings. The general court finds that: I. New Hampshire has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children; II.(a) Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex. (b) According to the American Psychiatric Association, โFor natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent, and for natal females, from 0.002 to 0.003 percent.โ; III. For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary; IV. Furthermore, scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health services to address comorbidities and underlying causes of their distress before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention; V. Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population; VI.(a) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex. (b) The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition; VII. Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition; VIII. The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks, such as: (a) For biological females: (1) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; (2) Severe liver dysfunction; (3) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; (4) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; (5) Hypertension; (6) Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers; and (7) Irreversible infertility; and (b) For biological males: (1) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots; (2) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones; (3) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; (4) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland; (5) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; (6) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood; (7) Breast cancer; and (8) Irreversible infertility; IX. Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent; X.(a) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts. (b) For biological males, surgery may involve: (1) Genital reconstruction including penectomy, which is the removal of the penis; (2) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles; (3) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure; (4) Clitoroplasty, which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and (5) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure. (c) For biological females, surgery may involve: (1) A hysterectomy or oophorectomy; (2) Reconstruction of the urethra; (3) Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like structure; (4) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina; (5) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like and scrotum-like structure; and (6) Implantation of erection or testicular prostheses; XI. The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex; XII.(a) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts. (b) For biological males, this surgery may involve: (1) Augmentation mammoplasty; (2) Facial feminization surgery; (3) Liposuction; (4) Lipofilling; (5) Voice surgery; (6) Thyroid cartilage reduction; (7) Gluteal augmentation; (8) Hair reconstruction; and (9) Other aesthetic procedures. (c) For biological females, this surgery may involve: (1) A subcutaneous mastectomy; (2) Voice surgery; (3) Liposuction; (4) Lipofilling; (5) Pectoral implants; and (6) Other aesthetic procedures; XIII.(a) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product is increased. (b) Between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by nearly twenty percent in the United States; XIV. It is of grave concern to the general court that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and XV. The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures. 3 New Chapter; System of Gender Dysphoria Care for Minors.

The general court finds that: I. Parents are the primary educators of their children. II. Parents are solely responsible for teaching their children about matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality. III. When parents choose to send their children to a public school, they do not waive their right to be the sole educator of their children about matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality. IV. Parents are entitled to deference in these matters and should not be contradicted by the government. V. Modesty falls within the scope of faith, moral and sexuality teachings, and parents should expect their children to be safe to express their modesty while in a public school. VI. Forcing a student to share a restroom, locker/changing room or shower with a student of the opposite sex is a direct contradiction to the concept of modesty and is a clear government interference in a parentโs right to teach their children as their faith, or personal moral code allows. VII. Teaching a student that there are more than two genders infringes on a parentโs right to be the sole educator in matters of faith, morals and sexuality, as many religious faiths teach that there are but two genders; male and female. VIII. Teaching a student that they are free to choose their own gender, name, pronoun, or sexual orientation violates a parentโs right as sole educator related to matters of faith, morals and matters relating to sexuality and is a government violation of that right. IX. There is no credible scientific evidence that a person is anything other than the gender and biological sex that they are born with and any claim to the contrary is based upon subjective, psychological, individual feelings. This area of human study is controversial and far from settled science. As such, teachings related to this complex and controversial concept are inappropriate for a pre-k through 12 public school setting. X. Biological males are physically different than biological females. Males generally, are physically stronger and as such, any physical competition between biological males and biological females is fundamentally unfair. Furthermore, such competition can result in physical injury to the female participant if contact is involved. Allowing biological males to participate in female sports is both dangerous and unfair to female athletes. This diminishes female achievement, sets back womenโs rights and limits future collegiate scholarship opportunity and denies them the recognition they are due for their hard work in their sport of choice that is reserved to female athletes. 5 New Subdivision; Pupils; Sex and Gender in Public Schools. Amend RSA 193 by inserting after section 40 the following new subdivision:Sex and Gender in Public Schools 193:41 Sex and Gender in Public Schools. I. All public schools in kindergarten through grade 12 in New Hampshire shall refer to children by the name and gender that they are enrolled as. This shall apply to all verbal and written communications, records, or in any other way that the students may be referenced. Schools shall not allow the teaching of different pronouns other than those in common use in the English language when referring to the male or female. School staff shall use the appropriate pronoun for studentโs gender as listed in the enrollment by their parents. Educators in grades kindergarten through 8, are prohibited from teaching that gender is a choice, optional or fluid and that there are more than 2 genders: male and female. Educators in grades 9 through 12 are prohibited from teaching that gender is a choice, optional or fluid and that there are more than 2 genders: male and female, except as a part of an approved psychology course setting where the educator is a licensed child psychologist, and they may only teach that there may be more than 2 genders in the context of teaching about the mental health condition known as gender dysphoria. Prior to any lesson, class or assignment that proposes there are more than the male and female genders, the school shall obtain written permission from the parents. The permission notice shall explain in detail the contents of the lesson, class or assignment. Parents shall have the right to opt their child out of such lesson, class or assignment, and students themselves may choose not to participate if the subject matter makes them uncomfortable. Any studentโs failure to participate shall not be used in calculating their grades. No grade or incomplete status shall be noted in the studentโs records for failure to participate in such lesson, class or assignment. II. In any New Hampshire public school that offers regular or extracurricular activities that are separated by gender or sex (male or female), any student participating shall only be allowed to participate in the group that corresponds to their biological sex as listed at their time of birth. No student shall be discriminated against by not being allowed to participate in such an activity based on their personally identifying as a gender other than that identified at their time of birth but they shall nonetheless only participate in the activity that corresponds to their biological sex at their time of birth. III. School restrooms shall be separated by sex (male and female), and students may only use the restroom that corresponds to their biological sex as listed on their birth certificate. IV.(a) Anyone violating a provision of this subdivision shall be considered to have violated the terms of their licensure and shall be subject to discipline by their licensing authority up to and including the revocation of their license. This shall also be considered grounds for immediate termination from employment for cause, any union or employment contract notwithstanding. (b) Any student or parent aggrieved by a violation of this section may bring a cause of action in court and may be granted actual damages as well as legal fees. (c) The attorney general, upon referral by the department of education, a parent or student, shall bring any necessary action to enjoin any ongoing violation of this section and defend any actions brought under this section. 6 Definition; Conversion Therapy. Amend RSA 332-L:1 to read as follows: 332-L:1 Definition. In this chapter, "conversion therapy" means practices or treatments that seek to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity against their clearly expressed will, including further efforts against their will to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same gender. Conversion therapy shall not include counseling of a child enrolled in therapy at the request of their parent for the evaluation of, and treatment for, gender dysphoria, or that provides assistance to a person undergoing therapy for gender dysphoria and who, after reaching the age of 18, wishes to discuss gender transition from or to their biological gender, or counseling that provides a person over the age of 18 acceptance, support, and understanding of a person or facilitates a person's coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, including sexual-orientation-neutral interventions to prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices, as long as such counseling does not seek to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity against their clearly expressed will. 7 Effective Date. This act shall take effect January 1, 2024. LBA 23-0071 1/10/23 HB 619-FN- FISCAL NOTEAS INTRODUCED AN ACT prohibiting gender transition procedures for minors, relative to sex and gender in public schools, and relative to the definition of conversion therapy. FISCAL IMPACT: [ X ] State [ ] County [ ] Local [ ] None Estimated Increase / (Decrease) STATE:FY 2023FY 2024FY 2025FY 2026 Appropriation$0$0$0$0 Revenue$0$0$0$0 Expenditures$0IndeterminableIndeterminableIndeterminable Funding Source: [ X ] General [ ] Education [ ] Highway [ ] Other The Legislative Budget Assistant Office is awaiting information from the Department of Justice. The Department was contacted for a fiscal note worksheet on January 6, 2023. METHODOLOGY:This bill prohibits gender transition procedures for individuals under the age of 18 and prohibits the use of funds for these procedures. The Department of Health and Human Services anticipates a reduction in Medicaid funds as a result of the services, therapies, and medications that would no longer be performed or offered. However, the Department also anticipates that the bill may result in an "undefined level of risk" of disallowance of federal matching funds under Medicaid, as federal law and regulations are currently unsettled on the matter of whether states may prohibit public funds from being used for gender transitions and related treatments. The Judicial Branch notes that violations of the proposed new chapter would be subject to civil proceedings in court. In addition, the bill creates a new subdivision in RSA 193 relative to sex and gender in public schools, and would entitle the attorney general to seek an action in court to enjoin any ongoing violation of the section. The Branch is unable to determine the number of new cases that may be brought as a result of the bill. The Department of Education states there is no anticipated costs to local school districts as a result of the bill.

For the purposes of state law: (a) A person's "sex" is defined as his or her biological sex (either male or female) at birth; (b) A "female" is an individual whose biological reproductive system is developed to produce ova; a "male" is an individual whose biological reproductive system is developed to fertilize the ova of a female; (c) The terms "woman" and "girl" refer to human females, and the terms "man" and "boy" refer to human males; and (d) The term "mother" is defined as a parent of the female sex, and the term "father" is defined as a parent of the male sex. SECTION 4. There are legitimate reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, or other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, locker rooms, restrooms, and other areas where biology, safety and/or privacy are implicated. SECTION 5. Policies and laws that distinguish between the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional scrutiny which forbids unfair discrimination against similarly-situated males and females but allows the law to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to important governmental objectives. SECTION 6. Any public school or school district and any state or local agency, department, or office that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with anti-discrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime, economic or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set as either male or female at birth.

Pursuant to the Establishment Clause of th e First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, a public school is prohibited fro m creating, enforcing, or endorsing a policy that respects, favors, endorses, or promotes n on-secular self -asserted sex-based identity narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy because such policies fail the lemon test for: 1. Constituting non -secular sh ams that lack a primary secular purpose; 2. Cultivating indefensible legal weapons against non-observers of the re ligion of secular humanism; and 3. Having the effect of excessively entangling the govern ment with the religion of secular humanism. B.

H. All publ ic school officials that violate subsection A or B of this section may be declared to be in violation of their oath of office establish ed under Article VI , Clause 3 of the United States Constitution and subjected to declaratory relief for such a violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. I. Sincerity of belief o r emotional appeals may not constitute a valid defense for a violation u nder subsection A or B of this section. SECTION 5. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1-130 of Title 70, unless there is created a duplication in numb ering, reads as follows: Req. No. 1625 Page 12  A. Pursuant to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, a public school shall not discriminate against any person for believing in or for failing to believe in the plausibility of non-secular self -asserted sex -based ident ity narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy.

Req. No. 1625 Page 13  SECTION 6. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1-131 of Title 70, unless there is created a duplication in numb ering, reads as follows: A. The School Establishment Clause Act (S ECA) is constructed on the premise that: 1. The United States is a constitutional republic of which the State of Oklahoma is a part; 2. The United States Cons titution is the supreme sovereign law of this country that preempts all state and federal law; 3. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; 4. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution wer e not merely designed to prevent the state from respecting and promoting the doctrines of institutionalized religions but tho se of non -institutionalized religions ; 5. All members of the Legislature and all executive and judicial officers are b ound by oath or affirmation pursuant to Article VI, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution to not create or enforce policies that vi olate the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United S tates Constitution regard less of the member โs or officer โs party affiliation or personal religious beliefs; Req. No. 1625 Page 14  6. The Establishment Clause balanced with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is the controlling constitutional authority in in forming this state on how to respond and react to self -asserted sex -based identity narratives and sexual orientation orthodox y and the Equal Protection and substantive Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution have no applicability; 7. Emotional appeals shall not be used to usurp the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution in an effort to justify the governmentโs creation or enforcement of policies that respect non -secular self -asserted sex -based identity narratives or sexual orientation orthodoxy; 8. All policies put forth by public schools that resp ect or recognize non-secular self -asserted sex -based identity narratives and sexual orientation orthodoxy fail the lemon test first established by the United States Supreme Court and are thereby preempted by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, S ection 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution in their making and enforcement and shall be enjoined from enforcement because the policies: a. constitute n on-secular shams that lack a primary secular purpose; Req. No. 1625 Page 15  b. cultivate indefensible legal weapons against non- observers of the religion of secular humanism; and c. have the effect of excessively entangling the government with the religion of secular h umanism; 9. The Legislature recognizes that in the wake of the deci sions by the United States Supreme Court that force d the state โs entanglemen t with the religion of secular humanism, there has been no rush on non -secular marriage, but there has been a rush on: a. public schools and public libraries by devout secular humanists for the sole purpose of targeting and indoctrinating minors wi th the licentious religion of secular humanism with the government โs stamp of approval at the taxpayers โ expense, and b. the social marginalization and systematic persecution of non-observers of the religion of secular humanism; 10. The Legislature recognizes that it is not proven or disproven whether sexual orientation is predicated on immutability and genetics an d is, therefore, a matter of religious faith that falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Establishment Clause balanced with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I I, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution; and 11. This state shall be particularly vigilant in monitori ng compliance with the Establishment Clause of the United States Req. No. 1625 Page 16  Constitution in the public school context to protect minors from religious indoctrination with the government โs stamp of approval, especially when th at religious ideology promotes licentiousn ess. B. SECA shall not be construe d as prohibiting students or teachers from believing in or from ref using to believe in the plausibility of non -secular self -asserted sex -based identity narratives or sexual orient ation orthodoxy or secular humanist practices because such beliefs and practi ces are protected under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and under Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution . SECA shall be constructed on the premise that protections of religious practices under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution are not absolute, and this state is author ized to regulate or prohibit certain relig ious practices pursuant to its inhe rent police powers afforded u nder the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution if those practices promote licentiousness or are inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state. The Legislature recognizes tha t it is self-evident that non -secular self-asserted sex-based identity narratives and sexual orie ntation orthodoxy promote licentiousness and attempt s to justify practices are inconsistent with the peace and safety of this state. Req. No. 1625 Page 17  SECTION 7. NEW LAW A new section of l aw to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1-132 of Title 70, unless there is created a duplication in numb ering, reads as follows: If any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of the School Establish ment Clause Act (SECA) is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, the holding shall n ot affect the constitutionality or validity of the remaining portions of SECA, the Legislature hereby declaring that it would have passed this and each and eve ry section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and word thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses, phrase s, or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional, invalid, or otherwise ineffective. SECTION 8. NEW LAW A new section of law not to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows: The Legislature hereby recognizes the following findings : 1. The Unite d States Constitution is not silent as to how this state shall respond and react to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) issues and sexual orientation orthodoxy for the matters are addressed exclus ively by the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, not the substan tive Due Process Req. No. 1625 Page 18  Clause or Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which have no applicability; 2. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that the government โshall make no law respecting an estab lishment of religion ,โ and Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution states, โPublic money or property - Use for sectarian purposes. No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, o r used, directly or indirectly, for th e use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, o r for the use, benefit, or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institut ion as such โ; 3. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that the governme nt โshall make no law...prohibiting the free exercise [of religion] โ; 4. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constit ution applies to this state through the Fourteenth A mendment, and the United States Supreme Court held in Hein v. Freedom From Religion Found ation Inc., 551 U.S. 587 (2007) that the Establishment Clause applies to the executive branch, which includes Oklahoma โs public schools; 5. The Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution was never solely desi gned to prohibit the government from res pecting Req. No. 1625 Page 19  and recognizing the doctrines of institutionalized religions but of non-institutionalized religions, such as secular humanism; 6. The United States Supreme Court found that secular humanism is a religion for the purposes of the First Amendment in: a. Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961) , b. School District of A bington Township, P a. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) , c. United States v. Seeger, 380 US 163 (1 965), and d. Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1 970); 7. Most of the United States cou rts of appeals have found that secular humanism is a religion for purposes of th e First Amendment in cases such as: a. Malnak v. Yogi, 592 F.2d 197 (3d Cir.1979) , b. Theriault v. Silber, 547 F.2d 1279 (5th Cir.1977) , c. Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707 ( 1981), d. Lindell v. McCallum, 352 F.3d 1107 (7th Cir.2003) , e. Real Alternatives, Inc. v. Sec โy Depโt of Health & Human Servs.,150 F.Supp. 3d 419, 2017 WL3324690 (3d Cir. Aug.4, 2017) , and f. Wells v. City and County of Denver, 257 F.3d 1132 (10th Cir. 20 01); 8. Several former self -identified homosexual activ ists, medical experts, licensed ministers, and persecuted Christians have testified under oath that non -secular self -asserted sex -based Req. No. 1625 Page 20  identity narratives, such as homosexuality and transgenderism, a nd sexual orientation orthodoxy are doctrines, ideologie s, and dogmas that are part of a worldview consisting of a series of unproven faith-based assumptions and naked asserti ons that are implicitly religious and inse parably linked to the religion of secul ar humanism; 9. The LGBTQ community is centered on a โclosed system โ that is organized, full, and provides a comprehensive code by which individuals may guide their daily acti vities, making LGBTQ secular humanism a r eligion in view of the legal definition of what constitutes a religion provided by the courts i n cases such as United States v. Seeger, 380 US 163 (1965); Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970); and Real Alternativ es, Inc. v. Sec โy Depโt of Health & H uman Servs.,150 F. Supp. 3d 419 (3d Cir. Au g. 4,2017); 10. Instead of having a cross, the Ten Commandments, or the star and crescent, the LGBTQ secular humanist religion has the rainbow-colored flag to symbolize its rel igious beliefs, practices, and value s; 11. The beliefs that a person โwas born with a gay gene โ or โwas born in the wrong body โ and is thereby entitled to special treatment amounts to a series of unproven faith -based assumptions and naked assertions that are implicitly religious and cannot be used as the basis for law and policy bec ause the Establishment Req. No. 1625 Page 21  Clause prohibits such beliefs fro m being legally promoted, endorsed, or respected by government; 12. Regardless of political affiliation, all members of the Legislature and all executive an d judicial officers are bound by oath to pu t their own political and religious beliefs aside and to comply with their duty to honor their oath of office pursuant to Article VI , Clause 3 to uphold the United States Constitution and to, therefore, immediatel y stop creating, respecting, and enforcing policies that promote the plausibility of non -secular se lf-asserted sex-based identity narratives and sexual orientation orthodoxy because all of those policies fail all three prongs of the lemon test established by the United States Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) for: a. constituti ng non-secular shams that lack a primary secular purpose , b. cultivating indefensible legal weapons against non - observers of the religion of secular humanism , and c. serving to excessively entangle the go vernment with the religion of secular humani sm; 13. The United States Supreme Court in Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987) and Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (199 7) found that if government action fails o ne prong of the lemon test, it is unconstit utional, and the evidence shows that the enf orcement and creation of policies that respect non -secular self -asserted sex - Req. No. 1625 Page 22  based identity narratives or sexual orientation id eology fail all three prongs of the lemon test; 14. The United States Supreme Court in Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992) found that there are โheightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and s econdary public schools, โ while also hold ing in Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 ( 1987) that the government โshould be particu larly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in the public -school context, โ when minors are subjected t o religious indoctrination with the perce ption of the government โs stamp of approval ; 15. The federal courts have held in cases like Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3 1252 (11th Cir. 2004) that neither emotional appeals nor sincerity of belief can be used to usurp the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and all policies that respect a nd promote non-secular self -asserted sex -based identity narratives and sexual orientation orthodoxy have been based on a series of emotional appeals at the expense of this principle; 16. The Supreme Court in Ober gefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), Uni ted States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013 ), and Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019) misapplied the Fourteenth A mendment through an unpri ncipled ploy and issued decisions that w ere based solely on a series of emotional Req.

Hodges,135 S.Ct. 2584 (201 5), United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), and Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. B d. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019), there has not been the promised equality, tolerance, and unity, but instead there has been division, domination by secular huma nists, the proliferation of moral superio rity complexes by moral relativists, cancel culture, the erosion of the integrity of the legal basis supporting the race -based civil rights movement which is objectively based on immutability, increased sexual explo itation and licentiousness, the prolifera tion of sexual confusion amongst minors, and the marginalization and even violent oppres sion of non - observers of the religion of secular humanism, demonstrating that those decisions amount to some of the greatest no n-secular shams since the inception of Am erican jurisprudence; 18. The United States Supreme Courtโs position in INS v. Chada, 462 U.S. 919 (1983) and Nixon v. U.S., 506 U.S. 224 (1993) emphasized that the legislative branch shall serve as a check on the judicial and exe cutive branch, and by ena cting the School Establishment Clause Act (S ECA), the legislature shall be fulfilling that duty; 19. The United States Supreme Court held in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. South Carolina, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) and in St. Joseph Stoc k Req. No. 1625 Page 24  Yards Co. v. United States, 2 98 U.S. 38 (1936) that โStare Decisis is at its weakest when the Supreme Court interpret s the Constitution because its decisions can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling prior decisions โ; 20. Obergefel l v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2 015), United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 26 75 (2013), and Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019) merely involved constitutional interpretation which means that Stare Decisis is at its weakest inv olving those decisions; 21. The United States Supreme Court in Cooper Ind ustries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc. 543 U .S. 157 (2004) stated that โ[constitutional] questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to [the] attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to con stitute precedents; โ 22. In Bostock v. Clay ton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019), Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015) , and United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), the controlli ng applicability of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution regarding sexual orientation orthodoxy was lurking in the shadows of those cases but not decided upon by the Supreme Court, whic h means that Stare Decisis does not apply, and those cases are subjecte d to being overruled for being framed on the wrong constitutional narrative; Req. No. 1625 Page 25  23. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the states have a compelling interest to uphold community standards of decency, to discourage licentiousness, and to enact policies that stop attempts to justify practices that are inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state, as underscored by the state โs inherent police powers in the Tenth Amendment to the United Stat es Constitution; 24. The United States Supre me Court found in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968) and Mishkin v. State of New York, 383 U.S. 502 (1966) that โto simply adjust the definition of obscenity to social realities ha s always failed to be pe rsuasive before the Courts of the United Stat esโ, and such adjustments fail to be persuasive to this state ; 25. Courts, in cases like Schlegel v. United States, 416 F. 2d 1372 (Ct. Cl. 1969), have held as a matter of self -evident observation that โany schoolboy knows that a homosexual act is immoral, in decent, lewd, and obscene. Adult persons are even more conscious that this is true โ; 26. A public school policy that permits self -identified transvestites who are biological males to participate in sports for biological females in an attemp t to show resp ect to their non - secular self -asserted sex -based identity narrative fails the three prongs of the lemon test by a landslide, promotes licentiousness, erodes community standards of decency, and is an attempt to justify Req. No. 1625 Page 26  practices that are incon sistent with t he peace and safety of the state; 27. The United States Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 139 S.Ct. 1599 (2019) was invalid because requiring that โsexual orientation โ be read into the term โsexโ in Title VIII, 42 U. S.C. ยง2000eโ2(a)(1) causes th e statute to lack a primary secular purpose and excessively entangles the government with the religion of secular humanism as advocated by the LGBTQ denominatio n; 28. Males and females are self -evidently differ ent but equal as implicated by the following neutral and secular considerations: a. according to the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), there are โinherent d ifferences betwee n men and women, โ and these diffe rences โremain c ause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual โs opportunity โ, b. these โinherent differences โ range from chromosom al and hormonal d ifferences to physiological diffe rences, c. according to Neel Burt on, โThe Battle of the Sexes, โ 33 Psychology Today (July 2, 2012), men generally have โdenser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments โ and Req. No. 1625 Page 27  โlarger hearts, greater lung volum e per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, an d higher hemoglo binโ, d. according to Doriane Lambelet Coleman, โSex in Sport โ, Law and Contemporary Problems 63 -126 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, โMen, Women 2 and Speed. Words: Got Testosterone? โ, N.Y. Tim es (Aug. 21, 2008 )), men also have higher natural levels of testos terone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during phy sical activity , e. the biological differences between men and women, especially related to natural levels of testosterone, explains the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have life-long effects, including those m ost important fo r success in sport: categorically different strength, speed, and endurance, according to Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, โComparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men, โ Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy , f. while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the United States Supreme Court in United Req. No. 1625 Page 28  States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), recognized that โsex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation โs people โ, g. one place where sex classifications allow for the โfull development of the talent and capac ities of our Nationโs people โ is in the context of sports and athletics , h. courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result in different athletic ca pabilities. For example, Kleczek v. Rhode Island Inter scholastic 26 League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ( โBecause of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition. โ); Petrie v.

A recent Req.

WHEREAS, Male and female individuals possess unique and immutable biological differences that manifest prior to birth and increase as such individuals age and experience puberty; and WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes mean that only female individuals are able to become pregnant, give birth and breastfeed children; and WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes mean that male individuals are, on average, bigger, stronger and faster than female individuals; and WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes leave female individuals more physically vulnerable than male individuals to specific forms of violence, including sexual violence; and WHEREAS, Female individuals have historically suffered from discrimination in education, athletics and employment; and WHEREAS, Biological differences between the sexes are enduring and may, in some circumstances, warrant the creation of separate social, educational, athletics or other spaces in order to ensure safety and to allow members of each sex to succeed and thrive; and WHEREAS, Inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives with respect to the definitions of "sex," "male," "female," "man" and "woman" have led to the endangerment of single-sex spaces and resources thereby necessitating the clarification of certain terms. Now, therefore: Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas: Section 1. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, with respect to the application of an individual's biological sex pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations, the following shall apply: (1) An individual's "sex" means such individual's biological sex, either male or female, at birth; (2) a "female" is an individual whose biological reproductive system is developed to produce ova, and a "male" is an individual whose biological reproductive system is developed to fertilize the ova of a  25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36SB 180 2 female; (3) the terms "woman" and "girl" refer to human females, and the terms "man" and "boy" refer to human males; (4) the term "mother" means a parent of the female sex, and the term "father" means a parent of the male sex; (5) with respect to biological sex, the term "equal" does not mean "same" or "identical"; and (6) with respect to biological sex, separate accommodations are not inherently unequal. (b) Laws and rules and regulations that distinguish between the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional scrutiny. Intermediate constitutional scrutiny forbids unfair discrimination against similarly situated male and female individuals but allows the law to distinguish between the sexes where such distinctions are substantially related to important governmental objectives. Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, distinctions between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons or other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, locker rooms, restrooms and other areas where biology, safety or privacy are implicated that result in separate accommodations are substantially related to the important governmental objectives of protecting the health, safety and privacy of individuals in such circumstances. (c) Any school district, or public school thereof, and any state agency, department or office or political subdivision that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with anti-discrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, crime, economic or other data shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set as either male or female at birth. Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its publication in the statute book. 25 26 27 28 29 30UNOFFICIAL COPY 23 RS BR 943 Page 1 of 27 BR094300.100 - 943 - XXXX 2/7/2023 4:15 PM Jacketed AN ACT relating to education. 1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: 2 ๏ขSECTION 1.

B. 141 - 2 -(2) Only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying 16 with their biological sex. According to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence 17 ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent 18 for natal females; 19 (3) Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender 20 nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to 21 identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most 22 medical health care interventions unnecessary; 23 (4) Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their 24 biological sex of ten have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these 25 individuals should be encouraged to seek me ntal health care services before undertaking 26 any hormonal or surgical intervention; 27 (5) Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated 28 above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been 29 performed; 30 (6) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay 31 the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in children who experience distress at 32 identifying with their biological sex. This is being done despite the lack of any long-term 33 longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment 34 of such distress or gender transition; 35 (7) Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who 36 experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no 37 randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of 38 cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender 39 transition; 40 (8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks: 4123 LC 33 9320 S. B. 141 - 3 -(A) For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery 42 disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine 43 cancers, and irreversible infertility; and 44 (B) For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery 45 disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, 46 and irreversible infertility; 47 (9) Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for 48 children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are 49 becoming more frequent; 50 (10) Genital gender reassignment surgery incl udes several irreversible invasive procedures 51 for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and 52 functional body parts: 53 (A) For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including 54 penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty; and 55 (B) For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, 56 reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or 57 phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular 58 prostheses; 59 (11) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender 60 reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex; 61 (12) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for 62 males and females and also involves the alte ration or removal of biologically normal and 63 functional body parts: 64 (A) For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial 65 feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, 66 gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures; and 6723 LC 33 9320 S. B. 141 - 4 -(B) For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice 68 surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures; 69 (13) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or 70 product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases.

Gender reassignment medical services for minors. ยง16-66-1. Findings and Declarations. The West Virginia Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:(1) This state has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children;(2) Only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex. According to the American psychiatric association, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent for natal females;(3) Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender non-conforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical health care interventions unnecessary;(4) Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention;(5) Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been performed;(6) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay the onset or progression of normally-timed puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex. This is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition;(7) Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition;(8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks:(A) For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers, and irreversible infertility.(B) For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, and irreversible infertility.(9) Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent;(10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and functional body parts:(A) For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty.(B) For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular prostheses.(11) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex;(12) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts:(A) For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures.(B) For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures.(13) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases. Just between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by 20 percent;(14) It is of grave concern to the Legislature that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks;(15) The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures. ยง16-66-2. Definition of Sex. As used in this article, "sex" means the biological indication of male and female, including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, chosen, or subjective experience of gender. ยง16-66-3. Prohibited practices. (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no physician or other medical health care professional shall knowingly engage in or cause any of the following practices to be performed upon any person under the age of 18 if the practice is performed for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor's perception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the minor's sex as defined in this act:(1) Prescribing or administering puberty blocking medication to stop or delay normal puberty.(2) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic doses of testosterone or other androgens to females.(3) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic doses of estrogen to males.(4) Performing surgeries that sterilize, including castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy.(5) Performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the individual's sex, including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty.(6) Removing any healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue, except for a male circumcision.(b) No physician, mental health provider, or other medical health care professional shall knowingly engage in conduct that aids or abets the practices described in subsection (a) to any person under 18 years of age. This section may not be construed to impose liability on any speech or conduct protected by federal or state law.(c) Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to:(1) Services provided to individuals born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development, including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous, such as an individual born with 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with undervirilization, or having both ovarian and testicular tissue;(2) Services provided to an individual when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development, in which the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the individual does not have normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a biological male or biological female;(3) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been caused or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition procedures, whether or not the procedures were performed in accordance with state and federal law;(4) Any procedure undertaken because an individual suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that is certified by a physician and that would place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major bodily function unless surgery is performed. ยง16-66-4.
