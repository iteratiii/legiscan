New Hampshire has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children;\t\tII.(a)  Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex. \t\t\t(b)  According to the American Psychiatric Association, \xe2\x80\x9cFor natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent, and for natal females, from 0.002 to 0.003 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d;\t\tIII.  For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary;\t\tIV.  Furthermore, scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health services to address comorbidities and underlying causes of their distress before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention;\t\tV.  Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population;\t\tVI.(a)  Some health care providers are prescribing puberty blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex.\t\t\t(b)  The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition;\t\tVII.  Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition;\t\tVIII.  The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks, such as:\t\t\t(a)  For biological females:\t\t\t\t(1)  Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells;\t\t\t\t(2)  Severe liver dysfunction;\t\t\t\t(3)  Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks;\t\t\t\t(4)  Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes;\t\t\t\t(5)  Hypertension;\t\t\t\t(6)  Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers; and \t\t\t\t(7)  Irreversible infertility; and\t\t\t(b)  For biological males:\t\t\t\t(1)  Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots;\t\t\t\t(2)  Cholelithiasis, including gallstones;\t\t\t\t(3)  Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks;\t\t\t\t(4)  Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland;\t\t\t\t(5)  Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes;\t\t\t\t(6)  Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood;\t\t\t\t(7)  Breast cancer; and \t\t\t\t(8)  Irreversible infertility;\t\tIX.  Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent;\t\tX.(a)  Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts.\t\t\t(b)  For biological males, surgery may involve:\t\t\t\t(1)  Genital reconstruction including penectomy, which is the removal of the penis;\t\t\t\t(2)  Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles;\t\t\t\t(3)  Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure;\t\t\t\t(4)  Clitoroplasty, which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and \t\t\t\t(5)  Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure.\t\t\t(c)  For biological females, surgery may involve:\t\t\t\t(1)  A hysterectomy or oophorectomy;\t\t\t\t(2)  Reconstruction of the urethra;\t\t\t\t(3)  Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like structure;\t\t\t\t(4)  Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina;\t\t\t\t(5)  Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like and scrotum-like structure; and \t\t\t\t(6)  Implantation of erection or testicular prostheses;\t\tXI.  The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex;\t\tXII.(a)  Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts.\t\t\t(b)  For biological males, this surgery may involve:\t\t\t\t(1)  Augmentation mammoplasty; \t\t\t\t(2)  Facial feminization surgery;\t\t\t\t(3)  Liposuction;\t\t\t\t(4)  Lipofilling;\t\t\t\t(5)  Voice surgery;\t\t\t\t(6)  Thyroid cartilage reduction;\t\t\t\t(7)  Gluteal augmentation;\t\t\t\t(8)  Hair reconstruction; and \t\t\t\t(9)  Other aesthetic procedures. \t\t\t(c)  For biological females, this surgery may involve:\t\t\t\t(1)  A subcutaneous mastectomy;\t\t\t\t(2)  Voice surgery;\t\t\t\t(3)  Liposuction;\t\t\t\t(4)  Lipofilling;\t\t\t\t(5)  Pectoral implants; and \t\t\t\t(6)  Other aesthetic procedures;\t\tXIII.(a)  It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product is increased.\t\t\t(b)  Between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by nearly twenty percent in the United States;\t\tXIV.  It is of grave concern to the general court that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and\t\tXV.  The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.  3 \xc2\xa0New Chapter; System of Gender Dysphoria Care for Minors. \xc2\xa0Amend RSA by inserting after chapter 135-F the following new chapter:CHAPTER 135-GSYSTEM OF GENDER DYSPHORIA CARE FOR MINORS\t135-G:1 \xc2\xa0Definitions. \xc2\xa0In this chapter:\t\tI.

Parents are the primary educators of their children.\t\tII.  Parents are solely responsible for teaching their children about matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality.\t\tIII.  When parents choose to send their children to a public school, they do not waive their right to be the sole educator of their children about matters of faith, morals, and matters relating to their sexuality.\t\tIV.  Parents are entitled to deference in these matters and should not be contradicted by the government.\t\tV.  Modesty falls within the scope of faith, moral and sexuality teachings, and parents should expect their children to be safe to express their modesty while in a public school.\t\tVI.  Forcing a student to share a restroom, locker/changing room or shower with a student of the opposite sex is a direct contradiction to the concept of modesty and is a clear government interference in a parent\xe2\x80\x99s right to teach their children as their faith, or personal moral code allows.\t\tVII.  Teaching a student that there are more than two genders infringes on a parent\xe2\x80\x99s right to be the sole educator in matters of faith, morals and sexuality, as many religious faiths teach that there are but two genders; male and female.\t\tVIII.  Teaching a student that they are free to choose their own gender, name, pronoun, or sexual orientation violates a parent\xe2\x80\x99s right as sole educator related to matters of faith, morals and matters relating to sexuality and is a government violation of that right.\t\tIX.  There is no credible scientific evidence that a person is anything other than the gender and biological sex that they are born with and any claim to the contrary is based upon subjective, psychological, individual feelings.  This area of human study is controversial and far from settled science.  As such, teachings related to this complex and controversial concept are inappropriate for a pre-k through 12 public school setting.\t\tX.  Biological males are physically different than biological females.  Males generally, are physically stronger and as such, any physical competition between biological males and biological females is fundamentally unfair.  Furthermore, such competition can result in physical injury to the female participant if contact is involved.  Allowing biological males to participate in female sports is both dangerous and unfair to female athletes.  This diminishes female achievement, sets back women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and limits future collegiate scholarship opportunity and denies them the recognition they are due for their hard work in their sport of choice that is reserved to female athletes. 5 \xc2\xa0New Subdivision; Pupils; Sex and Gender in Public Schools. \xc2\xa0Amend RSA 193 by inserting after section 40 the following new subdivision:Sex and Gender in Public Schools\t193:41 \xc2\xa0Sex and Gender in Public Schools. \t\tI. \xc2\xa0All public schools in kindergarten through grade 12 in New Hampshire shall refer to children by the name and gender that they are enrolled as.  This shall apply to all verbal and written communications, records, or in any other way that the students may be referenced.  Schools shall not allow the teaching of different pronouns other than those in common use in the English language when referring to the male or female.  School staff shall use the appropriate pronoun for student\xe2\x80\x99s gender as listed in the enrollment by their parents.  Educators in grades kindergarten through 8, are prohibited from teaching that gender is a choice, optional or fluid and that there are more than 2 genders:  male and female.  Educators in grades 9 through 12 are prohibited from teaching that gender is a choice, optional or fluid and that there are more than 2 genders: male and female, except as a part of an approved psychology course setting where the educator is a licensed child psychologist, and they may only teach that there may be more than 2 genders in the context of teaching about the mental health condition known as gender dysphoria.  Prior to any lesson, class or assignment that proposes there are more than the male and female genders, the school shall obtain written permission from the parents.  The permission notice shall explain in detail the contents of the lesson, class or assignment.  Parents shall have the right to opt their child out of such lesson, class or assignment, and students themselves may choose not to participate if the subject matter makes them uncomfortable. \xc2\xa0Any student\xe2\x80\x99s failure to participate shall not be used in calculating their grades.  No grade or incomplete status shall be noted in the student\xe2\x80\x99s records for failure to participate in such lesson, class or assignment. \t\tII.  In any New Hampshire public school that offers regular or extracurricular activities that are separated by gender or sex (male or female), any student participating shall only be allowed to participate in the group that corresponds to their biological sex as listed at their time of birth.  No student shall be discriminated against by not being allowed to participate in such an activity based on their personally identifying as a gender other than that identified at their time of birth but they shall nonetheless only participate in the activity that corresponds to their biological sex at their time of birth.\t\tIII.  School restrooms shall be separated by sex (male and female), and students may only use the restroom that corresponds to their biological sex as listed on their birth certificate. \t\tIV.(a)  Anyone violating a provision of this subdivision shall be considered to have violated the terms of their licensure and shall be subject to discipline by their licensing authority up to and including the revocation of their license.  This shall also be considered grounds for immediate termination from employment for cause, any union or employment contract notwithstanding.\t\t\t(b)  Any student or parent aggrieved by a violation of this section may bring a cause of action in court and may be granted actual damages as well as legal fees.\t\t\t(c)  The attorney general, upon referral by the department of education, a parent or student, shall bring any necessary action to enjoin any ongoing violation of this section and defend any actions brought under this section. 6 \xc2\xa0Definition; Conversion Therapy. \xc2\xa0Amend RSA 332-L:1 to read as follows:\t332-L:1  Definition.  In this chapter, ""conversion therapy"" means practices or treatments that seek to change an individual\'s sexual orientation or gender identity against their clearly expressed will, including further efforts against their will to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same gender.  Conversion therapy shall not include counseling of a child enrolled in therapy at the request of their parent for the evaluation of, and treatment for, gender dysphoria, or that provides assistance to a person undergoing therapy for gender dysphoria and who, after reaching the age of 18, wishes to discuss gender transition from or to their biological gender, or counseling that provides a person over the age of 18 acceptance, support, and understanding of a person or facilitates a person\'s coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, including sexual-orientation-neutral interventions to prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices, as long as such counseling does not seek to change an individual\'s sexual orientation or gender identity against their clearly expressed will. \t7 \xc2\xa0Effective Date. \xc2\xa0This act shall take effect January 1, 2024.\xc2\xa0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLBA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23-0071\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1/10/23\xc2\xa0HB 619-FN- FISCAL NOTEAS INTRODUCED\xc2\xa0AN ACT\tprohibiting gender transition procedures for minors, relative to sex and gender in public schools, and relative to the definition of conversion therapy. \xc2\xa0FISCAL IMPACT: \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ X ] State \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0] County \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0] Local \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0] None\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0Estimated Increase / (Decrease)\n', b'\n', b'STATE:FY 2023FY 2024FY 2025FY 2026\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Appropriation$0$0$0$0\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Revenue$0$0$0$0\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Expenditures$0IndeterminableIndeterminableIndeterminable\n', b'\n', b'Funding Source:\xc2\xa0 [ X ] General \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0] Education \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0] Highway \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0[ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0] Other \n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa0The Legislative Budget Assistant Office is awaiting information from the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0The Department was contacted for a fiscal note worksheet on January 6, 2023.\xc2\xa0METHODOLOGY:This bill prohibits gender transition procedures for individuals under the age of 18 and prohibits the use of funds for these procedures. The Department of Health and Human Services anticipates a reduction in Medicaid funds as a result of the services, therapies, and medications that would no longer be performed or offered. \xc2\xa0However, the Department also anticipates that the bill may result in an ""undefined level of risk"" of disallowance of federal matching funds under Medicaid, as federal law and regulations are currently unsettled on the matter of whether states may prohibit public funds from being used for gender transitions and related treatments. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Judicial Branch notes that violations of the proposed new chapter would be subject to civil proceedings in court. In addition, the bill creates a new subdivision in RSA 193 relative to sex and gender in public schools, and would entitle the attorney general to seek an action in court to enjoin any ongoing violation of the section. \xc2\xa0The Branch is unable to determine the number of new cases that may be brought as a result of the bill.\xc2\xa0The Department of Education states there is no anticipated costs to local school districts as a result of the bill.\xc2\xa0AGENCIES CONTACTED:Judicial Branch, and Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Justice\xc2\xa0']"

Gender reassignment medical services for minors.\n', b'\n', b'\xc2\xa716-66-1. Findings and Declarations. \n', b'The West Virginia Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:(1) This state has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children;(2) Only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex. According to the American psychiatric association, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent for natal females;(3) Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender non-conforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical health care interventions unnecessary;(4) Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention;(5) Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been performed;(6) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay the onset or progression of normally-timed puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex. This is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition;(7) Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition;(8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks:(A) For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers, and irreversible infertility.(B) For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, and irreversible infertility.(9) Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent;(10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and functional body parts:(A) For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty.(B) For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular prostheses.(11) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex;(12) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts:(A) For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures.(B) For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures.(13) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases. Just between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by 20 percent;(14) It is of grave concern to the Legislature that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks;(15) The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.\n', b'\xc2\xa716-66-2. Definition of Sex.\n', b'As used in this article, ""sex"" means the biological indication of male and female, including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual\'s psychological, chosen, or subjective experience of gender.\n', b'\xc2\xa716-66-3. Prohibited practices.\n', b""(a) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no physician or other medical health care professional shall knowingly engage in or cause any of the following practices to be performed upon any person under the age of 18 if the practice is performed for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor's perception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the minor's sex as defined in this act:(1) Prescribing or administering puberty blocking medication to stop or delay normal puberty.(2) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic doses of testosterone or other androgens to females.(3) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic doses of estrogen to males.(4) Performing surgeries that sterilize, including castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy.(5) Performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the individual's sex, including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty.(6) Removing any healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue, except for a male circumcision.(b) No physician, mental health provider, or other medical health care professional shall knowingly engage in conduct that aids or abets the practices described in subsection (a) to any person under 18 years of age. This section may not be construed to impose liability on any speech or conduct protected by federal or state law.(c) Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to:(1) Services provided to individuals born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development, including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous, such as an individual born with 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with undervirilization, or having both ovarian and testicular tissue;(2) Services provided to an individual when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development, in which the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the individual does not have normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a biological male or biological female;(3) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been caused or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition procedures, whether or not the procedures were performed in accordance with state and federal law;(4) Any procedure undertaken because an individual suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that is certified by a physician and that would place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major bodily function unless surgery is performed.\n"", b'\xc2\xa716-66-4. Responsibilities of school personnel.\n', b""No nurse, counselor, teacher, principal, or other official or staff at a public or private school shall knowingly do either of the following:(1) Encourage or coerce a minor to withhold from the minor's parent or legal guardian the fact that the minor's perception of his or her gender is inconsistent with his or her sex;(2) Withhold from a minor's parent or legal guardian information related to the minor's perception that his or her gender is inconsistent with his or her sex.\n"", b'\xc2\xa716-66-5. Violations of article. \n', b""(a) The provision of services described in \xc2\xa716-66-3 of this code to any person under 18 years of age shall be considered unprofessional conduct and shall be subject to discipline by the licensing entity with jurisdiction over the physician, mental health provider, or other medical health care professional.(b) A person may assert an actual or threatened violation of this article as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding and obtain compensatory damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or any other appropriate relief.(c) A person shall be required to bring a claim for a violation of this article not later than two years after the day the cause of action accrues. A minor may bring an action before reaching 18 years of age through a parent or guardian, and may bring an action in the minor's own name upon reaching 18 years of age at any time from that point until 20 years after.(d) An action under this article may be commenced, and relief may be granted, in a judicial proceeding without regard to whether the person commencing the action has sought or exhausted available administrative remedies.(e) In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of this article, a prevailing party who establishes a violation of this chapter shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees.(f) The attorney general may bring an action to enforce compliance with this article. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to deny, impair, or otherwise affect any right or authority of the attorney general, the state, or any agency, officer, or employee of the state to institute or intervene in any proceeding.\xc2\xa0NOTE: The purpose of this bill is relating to gender reassignment medical services for minors; making findings and declarations; defining sex; establishing prohibited treatment for minors; providing exceptions; creating responsibilities for school personnel; and establishing consequences for violations of articleStrike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.""]"
